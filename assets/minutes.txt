00:11:56 <kaz> Topic: W3C Welcome (Ivan Herman)
00:11:56 <ivan> See [slides online](https://www.w3.org/2018/Talks/Tokyo-IH/Presentation.pdf)
00:12:19 <kaz> ivan: give brief introduction on what the W3C is like
00:13:12 <kaz> ... work at W3C is based on the cooperation of Members
00:13:31 <kaz> ... consensus is the center of our discussion
00:14:10 <kaz> ... "W3C" doesn't develop standards; "W3C Members" do
00:15:26 <kaz> ... AC Rep. to serve as liaison to W3C
00:16:01 <kaz> ... Advisory Board (AB) is elected by W3C Membership and meets quarterly with the W3C CEO
00:16:19 <kaz> ... Technical Advisory Group (TAG) with a focus on the architecture of the Web
00:16:31 <kaz> ... also note the W3C Royalty Free Patent Policy
00:16:39 <kaz> ... horizontal reviews
00:16:58 <kaz> ... accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security
00:17:07 <kaz> ... publishing@w3c
00:17:56 <kaz> ... publications as first class entities on the Web
00:18:22 <kaz> ... broadening W3C Membership - many companies involved
00:18:33 <kaz> ... history
00:18:47 <kaz> ... W3C and IDPF cooperation since 2013
00:18:58 <kaz> ... established an IG
00:19:19 <kaz> ... W3C was also part of the IDPF/IMS "EDUPUB" initiative
00:19:34 <kaz> ... and then W3C and IDPF are "merged" in Feb. 2017
00:20:06 <fantasai> fantasai has joined #tokyows
00:20:21 <kaz> ... publishing@W3C groups: Publishing BG, EPUB 3 CG, Publishing WG
00:21:46 <kaz> ... actually more
00:22:02 <kaz> ... number of issues
00:22:24 <kaz> ... relevant to publishing but not only for publishing
00:22:33 <kaz> ... e.g.:
00:22:40 <rachelnabors_> rachelnabors_ has joined #tokyows
00:22:51 <kaz> ... pagination and general page control - CSS
00:23:06 <kaz> ... accessibility - ARIA, AG
00:23:16 <kaz> ... goal of the workshop
00:23:53 <kaz> ... identify the technical problems and features that should be worked on in one of the existing W3C WGs
00:24:08 <kaz> ... hopefully identify experts that can join the group to do the work
00:24:28 <Shinya> Shinya has joined #tokyows
00:24:29 <kaz> ... if such a group doesn't exist, discuss whether a separate WG needed
00:24:45 <kaz> ... how W3C works
00:25:08 <kaz> ... Members move things forward!
00:25:21 <fantasai> Ivan shows a photo of a conference panel: this is not how W3C works. It's not a bunch of experts giving opinions.
00:26:10 <fantasai> Ivan shows a photo of a conference table with a variety of people sitting around it and lots of computer paraphernalia: This is how W3C works. It is a collaborative effort, everyone working together, lots of coffee and tea.

00:27:32 <dauwhe> Topic: Current Status and Pain Points
00:27:32 <dauwhe> Subtopic: The diversity of E-publishing worldwide (Luc Audrain)
00:11:56 <ivan> See [slides online](https://w3c.github.io/tokyo18-workshop/slides/UnfixedFixedLayout20180918.pdf)
00:28:04 <dauwhe> laudrain: where are we in digital publications?
00:28:12 <dauwhe> ... we have success with reflowable epubs
00:28:19 <dauwhe> ... but what about complex books?
00:28:25 <dauwhe> ... we have EPUB fixed layout (FXL)
00:28:41 <dauwhe> ... we could not do this kind of book without FXL
00:29:16 <dauwhe> ... our first FXL book was in 2011
00:29:41 <dauwhe> ... we have now produced many thousands of FXL books
00:30:08 <dauwhe> ... one example is education, where the pedagogy is "inside the layout"
00:30:14 <dauwhe> ... and we have comics/manga
00:31:16 <dauwhe> ... some books have many images, so each page is just an image
00:31:29 <dauwhe> ... and others have text + images, so the text is still searchable
00:33:14 <dauwhe> ... (covers technical details of FXL)
00:34:33 <dauwhe> ... "digital sequential art"
00:34:46 <dauwhe> ... there was ascii art before there was html
00:34:49 <Hyunwoo> Hyunwoo has joined #tokyows
00:35:18 <dauwhe> ... now there is turbo media, webtoons, applications
00:36:02 <dauwhe> ... there's a worldwide market, but with lots of diversity

00:36:58 <dauwhe> ... EPUB used in japan for manga, proprietary formats in US, EPUB and apps in Europe
00:37:11 <dauwhe> ... What are the problems?
00:37:27 <dauwhe> ... FXL isn't responsive, isn't webby, isn't accessible
00:37:42 <dauwhe> ... we (can) lose the semantics
00:38:12 <dauwhe> ... and there's conflict between the authors's intent of the layout and the user's experience
00:38:47 <dauwhe> ... there is no international standards for visual narratives in digital form
00:40:42 <dauwhe> ... thank you!
00:41:00 <fantasai> Scribenick: fantasai
00:41:00 <fantasai> Subtopic: EDRLab’s Work to Unify Digital Graphic Stories (Samuel Petit)
00:41:00 <ivan> See [slides online](https://w3c.github.io/tokyo18-workshop/slides/UnifyVisualNarrative.pdf)
00:47:14 <fantasai> SP: I'm collecting all the use cases of comics around the world so that we can have a standard that can accommodate them all
00:47:35 <fantasai> ... The BDCoMa (Bandes Desinées, Comics, Manga) group is producing a "format", it's a ckind of web publication for comics
00:47:43 <fantasai> ... IT's set as an extension to ePub
00:47:47 <fantasai> ... with a declarative approach
00:48:05 <fantasai> ... THis extension comes with resources: images, music, HTML, etc. Whatever you want.
00:48:19 <fantasai> ... The goals of the Wg
00:48:34 <fantasai> ... 1st is most important, it's  Total artistic control on the reader experience
00:48:53 <fantasai> ... e.g. if you have an epub reader that simulates page turns, the authors want to offer a transition, it will not work. That's a big issue.
00:49:05 <fantasai> ... Problem is that advanced digital publications have high cost
00:49:12 <fantasai> ... So 2nd goal is low production cost
00:49:31 <fantasai> ... Another goal is sustainability
00:49:38 <fantasai> ... This is why we are against a JS approach
00:49:44 <fantasai> ... Want authors to have things compatible in the long term
00:50:00 <fantasai> ... Paper book, can read 2000 years later. Same problem.
00:50:24 <fantasai> ... We have a retailers platform, briefly, we are a digital platform and have a large distribution chain in France
00:50:32 <fantasai> ... Sequencity is partner in France
00:50:54 <fantasai> ... I am  co-edirector of SAIL, building artificial intelligence to understand the content of comics
00:51:16 <fantasai> ... There is a young startup producing authoring tools, Kwalia. Important b/c authoring is an important part of the production chain
00:51:21 <fantasai> ... OK, so main use cases
00:51:34 <fantasai> ... Main one is page, you are familiar with this is the epub world
00:51:39 <fantasai> ... Classical maga, comics, use page
00:51:43 <fantasai> ... After that is the scrolling page
00:51:50 <fantasai> ... Some pages immediately, in epub we have a problem
00:51:59 <fantasai> ... Another use case is guided navigation
00:52:09 <fantasai> ... On small screens, guided navigation from panel to panel
00:52:15 <fantasai> ... It's a problem in terms of artistic presentation
00:52:37 <fantasai> ... It's a bad solution to read comics, but sometimes we need it. So it has to be part of the standardization.
00:52:55 <fantasai> ... Let's talk about scrolling content, and intra-page navigation
00:53:18 <fantasai> ... When you have scrolling content, you know that perfectly you have a fast market in Korea, also other areas.
00:53:28 <fantasai> ... IT's a comic which scrolls (shows example from Korea)
00:53:32 <fantasai> ... It's very very adapted to mobile
00:53:36 <fantasai> ... You read by scrolling the content
00:53:47 <fantasai> ... We have that also in France, but we didn't succeed to create a market
00:53:55 <fantasai> ... here you have a blog in animated gif, a very beautiful blog
00:54:09 <fantasai> ... Here is another author who is doing a very long scrolling story
00:54:22 <fantasai> ... Scrolling capability in epub would bring a lot of artistic possibilities
00:54:40 <fantasai> https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap-1/
00:54:46 <fantasai> ... That's the starting point. Problem comes just after
00:54:56 <fantasai> ... Something authors want to do, don't have in Epub
00:55:06 <fantasai> ... is simply to have starting point and have set direction in scroll
00:55:31 <fantasai> ... If you need to have a viewport ratio that's fixed, what then?
00:55:58 <fantasai> ... Some artists want padding between the drawing and the viewport to maintain this ratio.
00:56:15 <fantasai> ... Next is scrolling, sometimes need smooth scrolling, sometimes with snap points
00:56:34 <fantasai> ... Another issue is parallax, some comics use this technique
00:56:54 <fantasai> ... Here's an example of a french company which is doing black and white comics, you see they are using animation and parallax effects
00:57:29 <fantasai> ... This won the da Vinci prize in Japan
00:57:52 <fantasai> ... It's a page-fill ergonomic, but in fact it's scroll with parallax effects, and in some pages some animations
00:58:00 <fantasai> ... The animation is not a video inside an epub, this is an app
00:58:17 <fantasai> ... Unfortunately app is not available in latest version of iOS.
00:58:24 <fantasai> ... This is why we need a standard.
00:58:41 <fantasai> ... There is one more use case, it's when you add some effects
00:59:28 <fantasai> ... Here's an example, it is scrolling, but if you look closely some animated content, some parallax effects.
00:59:35 <fantasai> ... Very small animation, very small effects
00:59:51 <fantasai> (SP scrolls through the comic, e.g. fish slightly move)
01:00:06 <fantasai> ... We're finished with intra-page navigation, now inter-page navigation
01:00:29 <fantasai> ... Classical use cases, well, today the epub reading app has a transition. You turn the page, and you have an effect that is not decided by the author.
01:00:47 <fantasai> ... We remove the transition effect of the reading app, and let the author decide the transition effect.
01:01:06 <fantasai> ... Useful effect we want to add, there are basically two things. One is effect like fade, slide, change the sequence of images
01:01:26 <fantasai> ... two type of effect: time-based or control-based (e.g. as swiping, depends on speed of swipe)
01:01:36 <fantasai> ... Symmetric or non-symmetric effect
01:01:51 <fantasai> ... Back to navigation, a classic use case is turbomedia
01:01:58 <fantasai> ... One of the most basic the transition is a cut
01:02:26 <fantasai> ... A simple cut (shows examples where parts of the comic are added on, enew frames or word bubbles)
01:02:37 <fantasai> ... And of course, that kind of transition must work on all kinds of page.
01:02:47 <fantasai> ... Another topic was guided view.
01:03:00 <fantasai> ... Most powerful platforms in US are using a combination of transitions and guided navigation.
01:03:17 <fantasai> ... Multiple renditions is another issue
01:03:27 <fantasai> ... multilingual, multiple version s e.g. version 2,
01:03:42 <fantasai> ... responsive to environment, e.g. mobile vs tablet
01:03:54 <fantasai> ... Another concern is sections
01:04:21 <fantasai> ... Chapter by chapter, ur subscription
01:04:26 <fantasai> ... We are working on that.
01:04:36 <fantasai> ... New version of digital comics taxonomy, v3
01:04:40 <fantasai> ... focus on reading experience
01:04:46 <fantasai> ... This is part of the work in the manga working group
01:04:53 <fantasai> ... https://github.com/edrlab/bd-comics-manga
01:05:10 <fantasai> ... EDRlab is more than European, now global. We think we need members from Japan, Korea, the rest of the world.
01:05:14 <fantasai> ... Thank you.
01:06:02 <fantasai> Subtopic: Simple structure for fixed layout epub (Shinya Takami)
01:06:02 <ivan> See [slides online](https://w3c.github.io/tokyo18-workshop/slides/simple-fxl-epub180910.pdf)
01:06:40 <fantasai> ST: Technical director of Rakuten Kobo in 2012, of d-Magazzine in 2014
01:06:52 <fantasai> ... Unfortunately in Japan, over 86% of ebook sales is fixed layout
01:07:11 <fantasai> ... We try to convert text-based content in the past, but we couldn't reach the quality that publishers want
01:07:28 <fantasai> ... In this time efficiency of production, distribution, and presentation... opportunity is important
01:07:37 <fantasai> (Shinya shows graphs of ebook market)
01:07:46 <fantasai> ST: Before, we had domestic format in Japan
01:07:57 <fantasai> ... Changed to EPUB3 in Japan
01:08:25 <fantasai> ... EPUB is mainly used as a package mechanism
01:08:33 <fantasai> ... In Japan we have a standard FXL-EPUB
01:08:50 <fantasai> ... Fixed layout standard structure. But it's a little bit complicated, and we have XSHTML and CSS and image
01:08:56 <fantasai> ... Some SVG, something like that
01:09:08 <fantasai> ... But it's to complex to parse or convert
01:09:29 <fantasai> ... So many ebook services in japan convert epub to images and some settings for their reading system
01:09:52 <fantasai> ... So we have to convert EPUB to other formats
01:10:01 <fantasai> ... OPF is enough for conversion
01:10:09 <fantasai> ... XHTML and CSS are not used in many fixed layout services
01:10:25 <fantasai> ... Problem is SVG was very useful for fitting image in the screen
01:10:35 <fantasai> ... But the latest browsers behavior is different
01:10:53 <fantasai> ... Our Japanese standard is not the same as W3C's standard, so we have to change something.
01:11:02 <fantasai> ... I want to propose fixed layout  structure that is simpler.
01:11:22 <fantasai> ... spine & manifest link to JPEG, XHTML, PDF, Video directly
01:11:48 <fantasai> ... Current epub requires fallback to XHTML
01:12:04 <fantasai> ... We have some problems...
01:12:12 <fantasai> ... image map feature is used in ToC page
01:12:21 <fantasai> ... and also expected to use for advertisement
01:12:44 <fantasai> ... If we have only images and OPF, we have no way to indicate these maps
01:13:08 <fantasai> ... So maybe some alternatives to image map are needed
01:13:53 <fantasai> ... I think it's important to make these able to parse epub for new services, but currently the epub have to have some fallbacks for such images.
01:14:01 <fantasai> ... Want to discuss these fallbacks
01:14:14 <fantasai> ... We have to discuss alternative image map features for such simple epubs
01:14:22 <fantasai> ... Any good solutions? Enjoy to discuss. Thank you.
01:14:56 <fantasai> Subtopic: Questions, Discussion
01:15:01 <fantasai> Scribenick: dauwhe
01:16:05 <dauwhe> Kaz: I work for media and entertainment group
01:16:24 <dauwhe> ... there was discussion of time synchronized navigation
01:16:38 <dauwhe> ... there should be joint discussion among the publishing groups and MEIG, also TTWG
01:16:45 <dauwhe> ... we have been working on timed media
01:17:01 <dauwhe> ... perhaps we could discuss during TPAC
01:17:11 <dauwhe> ivan: we can try to fit into TPAC schedule
01:17:19 <dauwhe> Bobby_Tung: two questions
01:17:29 <dauwhe> ... IDPF had region-based navigation within your presentation spec
01:17:35 <dauwhe> SP: It was never really used
01:17:57 <dauwhe> ... it's a fine line between too ambitious and not ambitious enough
01:18:01 <dauwhe> ... too ambitious a standard is too hard to implement, not ambitious enough is not compelling or useful
01:18:23 <dauwhe> ... it was part of AHL group which was a failure
01:18:31 <dauwhe> ... the use cases were not well understood at that time
01:19:03 <dauwhe> Bobby_Tung: some browsers support animated PNG
01:19:48 <dauwhe> Florian_Dupas: You were asking whether we were investigating new formats for animations in a file to replace GIFs
01:20:03 <dauwhe> Bobby_Tung: the GIF format is too old, not enough colors
01:20:26 <dauwhe> ... can we find a common file format for animated images?
01:20:44 <dauwhe> Florian_Dupas: We're using aPNGs, as there is more capability for transparency
01:20:53 <dauwhe> ... we need to allow for any kind of resource
01:21:01 <dauwhe> ... it's not the job of the device to filter the formats
01:21:08 <dauwhe> ... any formats should be accepted
01:21:23 <dauwhe> ... the reading engine decides whether it can play it, and you need to provide a fallback
01:21:31 <dauwhe> ... we are pushing for aPNG
01:21:46 <dauwhe> SP: he's an active member of the manga WG
01:22:02 <dauwhe> r12a: what are i18n standards you're coming across?
01:22:19 <dauwhe> ... there are differences in reading direction between Japanese and english, and then there's Mongolian
01:22:27 <dauwhe> ... is there a market for RTL scripts?
01:22:40 <dauwhe> ... the absolute position stuff will be problematic if translated into RTL
01:22:48 <dauwhe> ... what are the i18n barriers you've come across
01:23:04 <dauwhe> laudrain: the text hasn't been addressed as text, it's image
01:23:23 <dauwhe> ... that was a hope from AHL to manage image and text in same pub, but we haven't done that
01:24:27 <dauwhe> SP: rising markets like Korea and US can lead to propriety formats
01:24:44 <dauwhe> ... we need next steps that are not too far, not too long-term
01:24:57 <dauwhe> ... to quickly put in the market something standard, something open source
01:25:15 <dauwhe> ... it's not a response to your question, but it's why we need to start from what we have today, EPUB3
01:25:21 <dauwhe> ... we have to build just above that, quickly
01:25:34 <dauwhe> Makoto: I'd like to respond to Richards question
01:25:57 <dauwhe> ... one example had RTL scroll, one had LTR
01:26:12 <dauwhe> ... do you find one direction uncomfortable?
01:26:28 <dauwhe> florian: I have a web-centric point of view
01:26:37 <dauwhe> ... you say we need to solve from what we have now, which is EPUB3
01:26:42 <dauwhe> ... but what we have is the web
01:26:45 <dauwhe> ... we should start there
01:27:01 <dauwhe> ... when you did intra-page navigation some of it is already possible, or soon will be possible, or would be reasonable to add to CSS or Web Animations
01:27:23 <dauwhe> ... what's missing in the web is transition between pages, as web doesn't have that concept
01:27:35 <dauwhe> ... for intra-page nav are you looking at what is already in CSS
01:28:01 <dauwhe> SP: it will be close to web, this will be in Laurent's presentation
01:28:13 <dauwhe> ... a web engine will need to read JSON
01:28:34 <dauwhe> florian: that scares me when you say similar, rather than the same
01:28:45 <dauwhe> llemeur: I will talk about this later
01:28:59 <dauwhe> florian: when you said you are looking for simpler format for FXL
01:29:21 <dauwhe> ... what if you start from the web, you can use HTML as container for images, and use scroll-snap and viewport images
01:29:35 <dauwhe> ... have you looked to use modern HTML/CSS as a replacement for FXL
01:30:02 <dauwhe> ST: it might be different for modern animated content
01:30:12 <dauwhe> ... maybe we need both
01:30:33 <dauwhe> florian: I was thinking we could use HTML rather than EPUB spine
01:31:12 <dauwhe> ivan: one goal of the Web Publications work (WPUB) is to introduce the idea of one "thing" on the web which has multiple resources
01:31:51 <dauwhe> ... which might help with inter-page transitions
01:32:20 <dauwhe> ... also, WPUB can use any resource on the web as content, so we could have a sequence of images, just as we could have a sequence of audio books
01:32:33 <dauwhe> ... the main resources could be audio files, or could be graphics files
01:32:55 <dauwhe> Makoto: a remark from historical viewpoint
01:33:14 <dauwhe> ... with FXL, we deviated from OWP, we abused spine and abused `itemref`
01:33:20 <dauwhe> ... so scrolling can't use browser engines
01:33:33 <dauwhe> ... the collection of pages is not html
01:33:45 <dauwhe> ... so Japanese manga engines do not use browser engines
01:33:58 <dauwhe> ... a long time ago, B&N proposed something similar a long time ago
01:34:16 <dauwhe> ... "if you already deviate from OWP, why not go all the way?"
01:34:20 <dauwhe> ... just do images in spine
01:34:38 <dauwhe> ... so now we have strange mixture of OWP and traditional representation.
01:34:44 <dauwhe> ... I have a mixed feeling.

02:06:14 <fantasai> PD: Discuss ... and drawbacks in ways that comics are created
02:06:20 <fantasai> ... digitalcomics.co
02:06:27 <fantasai> ... Common approaches to digital comics
02:06:32 <fantasai> ... Panel by panel presentations
02:06:48 <fantasai> ... Page of print comic is larger than most devices, problem on mobile devices especially earlier
02:07:01 <fantasai> ... Can cut page into panels, view comic panel by panel
02:07:15 <fantasai> ... Problem is that they undermine the storytelling experience by slicing up page meant to be viewed as a whole
02:07:23 <fantasai> ... Another approach is Balak Framework
02:07:39 <fantasai> ... Beyond adapting print comics for screen, take advantage of new medium
02:07:55 <fantasai> ... Experiments by depicting time by layering panels on top of each other, or shifting them over time
02:08:06 <fantasai> ... Limitation is no handling of varying viewport sizes
02:08:39 <fantasai> ... Static page monitor is not scalable. Similar to old Web, best viewed on Internet Explore -- best viewed on iPAd-sized device.
02:08:54 <fantasai> ... Not a great experience for viewing comics created for print
02:08:59 <fantasai> ... Have to letterbox it to fit
02:09:18 <fantasai> ... Web designers have realized that targeting only one screen size, we design fluid scenes that can adapt to multitude of viewing conditions.
02:09:30 <fantasai> ... Panel-presentation undermine full-page layout design, to reinforce the narrative
02:09:39 <fantasai> ... Visual juxtaposition of multiple panels on a page ...
02:09:50 <fantasai> ... You can see story how it progresses panel by panel,
02:10:06 <fantasai> ... But don't se relationship of the panels to each other on the page
02:10:24 <fantasai> ... Another problem with comics is that they are essentially photographs
02:10:35 <fantasai> ... They are large files that take a long time to download, more expensive for reader and publisher
02:10:44 <fantasai> ... Also loses semantics, not accessible.
02:10:54 <fantasai> ... Also relies on print-centric conventions.
02:11:18 <fantasai> ... E.g. this page shows a double-page spread. Double-page spreads enhance the reader experience in print
02:11:43 <fantasai> ... But on a tablet, becomes a point of friction. Effect of largeness changed to smallness, or need to reorient tablet
02:11:50 <fantasai> ... Need a new approach.
02:12:09 <fantasai> ... Screen connected to internet has very different characteristics than digital devices which have varying viewport sizes and unpredictable viewing conditions
02:12:21 <fantasai> ... Bandwidth, language, and screen resolution are just some of the variables need to take into account.
02:12:35 <fantasai> ... Can rely on Web development techniques for building comics
02:12:46 <fantasai> ... First, break the comic into constituent parts, so that we can reassemble in the browser.
02:13:03 <fantasai> ... Use HTML and CSS and responsive web design techniques, can build one page that can adapt to a world where we don't know what is happening.
02:13:07 <fantasai> ... Let me show you some demos
02:13:32 <fantasai> ... ... resolution-independent images (SVG)
02:13:46 <fantasai> ... Here's a simple layout, using CSS to make it responsive, but all panels are exactly the same
02:14:01 <fantasai> ... But using CSS Grid and Flexbox, we can do more sophisticated layouts, but also collapse them into mobile-friendly layouts.
02:14:07 <fantasai> ... You can explore on digitalcomics.co
02:14:15 <fantasai> ... Next is live text.
02:14:35 <fantasai> ... We can use live text instead of images of words. Text can be resized, searched, translated, and is more accessible.
02:14:45 <fantasai> ... Makes globalized comics easier to create for publishers.
02:15:01 <fantasai> ... Here you can see different examples, all live text in the word balloons.
02:15:06 <fantasai> ... Can resize as necessary, and it keeps its layout
02:15:17 <fantasai> ... Can move the word balloons around as you see fit, to adapt to different viewing conditions
02:15:35 <fantasai> ... Can use search, highlighting, etc. Every advantage of real text.
02:15:52 <fantasai> ... Finally, using resolution-independent artwork (vector images) makes comics accessible, lightweight, and scalable.
02:16:17 <fantasai> ... Some things will always need be raster-based, but so many aspects of comics can be done with vectors
02:16:28 <fantasai> ... Crisper images at all sizes, and lower bandwidth costs for users and publishers.
02:16:40 <fantasai> ... You can see to-planes.com uses some of these techniques
02:17:09 <fantasai> Pablo shows a comic panel where the relationship of background/foreground shifts as there is more or less width for the panel
02:17:36 <fantasai> ... Once you start building comics out of HTML and CSS, can recreate anything that's been done on a physical page.
02:17:57 <fantasai> ... What are the storytelling implications of mobile layout, tablet layout, desktop layout?
02:18:15 <fantasai> ... Cliffhangers and reveals happen in different ways on different sizes.
02:18:23 <fantasai> ... Use layout in service of the story
02:18:39 <fantasai> ... Thank you.

02:20:08 <fantasai> KO: I am trainer in Pokémon Go
02:20:32 <fantasai> ... Anyway, smaller company, agent company that also edits manga planning
02:20:42 <fantasai> ... eBook initiative in Japan, Torico, Naver are clients
02:21:00 <fantasai> ... Today I will tell you what I have [?]
02:21:24 <fantasai> ... I did questionnaire on Twitter. How are manga delivered in japan?
02:21:34 <fantasai> ... 23% images with rasterized text
02:21:46 <fantasai> ... 20% balloons without text, and text files
02:22:03 <fantasai> ... 57% compound format (psd, clip, mdp, etc.) containing ...
02:22:19 <fantasai> ... What are the advantages and disadvantages of these three types of data?
02:22:39 <fantasai> ... Image containing rasterized text (jpg, png, etc)
02:22:57 <fantasai> ... Advantage: can be published immediately
02:23:06 <fantasai> ... if there are no errors
02:23:19 <fantasai> ... Disadvantage: If there are errors, you must ask the manga artist to correct it
02:23:33 <fantasai> ... Also, Translation cannot be done
02:23:49 <fantasai> ... Also, if manga uses non-commercial fonts, can be a big problem in a later stage
02:24:04 <fantasai> ... This way should not be adopted. It is not more accessible than anything else.
02:24:21 <fantasai> ... Next is image without text. Manga artist give text files to manga editors along with image files
02:24:28 <fantasai> ... Image file balloons are blank
02:24:40 <fantasai> ... The manga editors use the text file and associate text chunks with each balloon
02:25:00 <fantasai> ... Advantages: Editors can correct mistakes themselves
02:25:10 <fantasai> ... Organize text for easy reading for the reader.
02:25:17 <fantasai> ... No worries about font licenses
02:25:24 <fantasai> ... Disadvantage is that it takes a lot of time.
02:25:38 <fantasai> ... It's a good way to work, but time consuming and boring work.
02:25:51 <fantasai> ... Next is compound format, e.g. PSD
02:26:08 <fantasai> ... Compound format containing both image and text
02:26:14 <fantasai> ... 57% use this approach
02:26:28 <fantasai> ... All have image data containing a text layer
02:26:44 <fantasai> ... Editors can receive characters with the same position, font, and font size as the manga artist designed
02:26:57 <fantasai> ... After proofreading, the editor outputs jpg/png/etc and publishes
02:27:18 <fantasai> ... Advantages: It is efficient because you can use text entered by the manga artist
02:27:27 <fantasai> ... easy to use on internet, book printing, or translation
02:27:37 <fantasai> ... As long as font used by manga artist and fonts by editors match, can publish
02:27:58 <fantasai> ... Disadvantages: It is very rare for the manga artist to publish that received data as they are, as fonts are different from delivery specifications
02:28:17 <fantasai> ... clip and mdp are not stable data formats for delivery. They are is similar to RAW image data in photographs
02:28:32 <fantasai> ... Danger that if you mistake the output setting a bit, dat different from a manga artists' intention will be created.
02:28:46 <fantasai> ... All of these formats are  proprietary, so we cannot exchange data across vendors
02:28:58 <fantasai> ... Conclusion, Japanese manga editors are exhausted with inefficient and useless work.
02:29:13 <fantasai> ... Most efficient way is to agree on the type  fonts before hand and use an image format containing text layer.
02:29:32 <fantasai> ... If there is an open standard for image formats equipped with text layers, the life of Japanese manga editors will be easier.
02:29:36 <fantasai> ... It might be SVG.

02:31:16 <fantasai> RN: I used to work in comics, now in web development.
02:31:24 <fantasai> ... Big fan of Japanese comics community, so special day.
02:31:34 <fantasai> ... You've heard about layout today from our speakers.
02:31:51 <fantasai> ... But stories exist on multiple ...
02:31:55 <fantasai> ... Spectrum of storytelling
02:32:11 <fantasai> ... We have static comics, and we have animated film, but it is a continuum, there are comics mixed with motion
02:32:18 <fantasai> ... You've seem some examples today
02:32:23 <fantasai> ... This is what a motion comic looks like.
02:32:29 <fantasai> ... Can publish to native android, iOS formats.
02:32:39 <fantasai> ... But don't have any HTML+CSS format
02:32:54 <fantasai> ... Here you are clicking through the comic.
02:33:02 <fantasai> ... It's like a glorified storyboard.
02:33:12 <fantasai> ... What makes comics exciting on the web is interaction component
02:33:16 <fantasai> ... visual novels are doing this already
02:33:23 <fantasai> ... And games are ultimate mix of animation and storytelling
02:33:40 <fantasai> ... THis is an example of a visual novel / game / comic book ... hard to describe what it is
02:33:51 <fantasai> ... It was all written as flash, but reproduced with images
02:34:00 <fantasai> ... This is an introduction animation to a portion of which is a game
02:34:17 <fantasai> ... This is a portion where it suddenly turns into a game: collect inventory items to get to the next page
02:34:29 <fantasai> ... So popular that kickstarter funded it
02:34:34 <fantasai> ... THis has gone on to inspire other people
02:34:47 <fantasai> ... This is a Russian artist who created comic inspired by Wizard of OZ
02:34:57 <fantasai> ... Here using Drag and Drop API to create a clean-up game
02:35:06 <fantasai> ... In the past we needed flash, but no longer true
02:35:17 <fantasai> ... Here is Emily Caroll, a horror cartoonist
02:35:25 <fantasai> ... Uses links on images that take you to different comics
02:35:43 <fantasai> ... Here is hobolobo, a sophisticated comic with sound
02:35:52 <fantasai> ... Really interesting examples come from comics who became web developers
02:35:59 <fantasai> ... Rich and sophisticated experiences
02:36:15 <fantasai> ... This example turns a browser into a synthesizer. No imported media, wuicktime, etc.
02:36:32 <fantasai> ... We have declarative animations with CSS, here's an example of Alice in Wonderland I made with adobe
02:36:46 <fantasai> ... Very efficient animations
02:37:00 <fantasai> ... For more sophisticated examples, use Web Animations API working on by Mozilla
02:37:19 <fantasai> ... Scroll snap
02:37:25 <fantasai> ... with css-scroll-snap spec
02:38:08 <fantasai> ... Pointer Events ... we don't know how user will interact with page, but pointer events gives a standard interface to accept such input whether by mouse or touch or future tech
02:38:21 <fantasai> ... CSS and SVG also have useful filters like blur, opacity, rotate, grayscale
02:38:31 <fantasai> ... We saw how SVG can be used to make clear line work stand out
02:38:45 <fantasai> ... But can also use it with layering to create high-resolution contrast and low-resolution color
02:39:01 <fantasai> ... If you layer SVGs and bitmaps -- high-resolution linework and low-resolution art
02:39:42 <fantasai> ... So you can have very high-resolution color graphics as well as ...
02:40:03 <fantasai> ... Also have <canvas>, which can recreate many capabilities of Flash
02:40:24 <fantasai> ... Here is ?? example, Neurotic neurons: An interactive explanation
02:40:29 <fantasai> ... You can interact with things on the screen
02:40:39 <fantasai> ... This is a style of storytelling humans can finally do really well
02:40:48 <fantasai> ... AnimationCC exports well to canvas, so very handy
02:41:01 <fantasai> ... What is the problem with this, why do we not see these things everywhere?
02:41:12 <fantasai> ... Flash gave one of the best interfaces for this, not the best ever, but very good
02:41:19 <fantasai> ... But Flash is not supported on phones or tablets.
02:41:36 <fantasai> ... after banned from iphone, browsers limit it on all devices
02:41:54 <fantasai> ... but HTML+CSS+JS have evolved to include many of these capabilities
02:42:18 <fantasai> ... But they are not very author-friendly
02:42:50 <fantasai> ... THere are some tools that export to SVG, but they are very fragile, lost when company goes away, and not sufficiently ambitious
02:43:04 <fantasai> ... Here is an example... it was created by google webdesigner
02:43:18 <fantasai> ... But not responsive, not scalable, and not really capable of doing what was necessary
02:43:22 <fantasai> ... real loss
02:43:34 <fantasai> ... Adobe Edge Animate from the experimental line
02:44:05 <fantasai> ... Existed long enough to be adopted by some artists, but then was shut down so leaving them with an outdated tool that is increasingly obsolete
02:44:15 <fantasai> ... Every time a tool dies, we lose the content that it created.
02:44:22 <fantasai> ... Open source tooling might actually live the longest.
02:44:37 <fantasai> ... Ren'py is an open-source tool written in python
02:44:55 <fantasai> ... This tooling platform is appealing enough that artists learn enough to create and contribute to the community
02:45:03 <fantasai> ... Javascript frameworks.
02:45:26 <fantasai> ... This is a retelling of sleeping beauty. Uses a JS framework in the background
02:45:51 <fantasai> ... We have JS frameworks that should make building the next interactive framework easy
02:46:04 <fantasai> ... Best part is that the foundations can be used for building fo native
02:46:28 <fantasai> ... And frameworks like react/view/??? can export to native as well as web
02:46:47 <fantasai> ... Graphic novel that won awards, no reason this can't be done with Web technology
02:47:12 <fantasai> ... There are so many things here that we can do on the Web, no reason that it needs to be limited to a studio in Toronto with a dedicated developer team
02:47:18 <fantasai> ... Web is the ultimate platform
02:47:25 <fantasai> ... ApIs for sound, motion, interaction
02:47:34 <fantasai> ... open source JS frameworks ...
02:47:43 <fantasai> ... Formats are cleverly put to use around the world
02:47:55 <fantasai> ... Here is a comic training moment to avoid problems in war-torn areas
02:48:15 <fantasai> ... Here is a magazine-type storytelling using animation
02:48:28 <fantasai> ... The Web provides a lot of opportunities for us. We don't know what it's limits are yet.
02:48:37 <fantasai> ... Who knows what we have ahead of us? Lot of room for expansion.

02:50:04 <ivan> See [slides online](https://w3c.github.io/tokyo18-workshop/slides/ReadingEngines.pdf)
02:50:19 <fantasai> LLM: We are about digital reading, but reading what? EPUB 3 and 2, reflow and fixed layout
02:50:33 <fantasai> ... CBZ comics (zipped sequence of images, essentially used for scanned comics)
02:50:36 <fantasai> ... Audiobooks
02:50:46 <fantasai> ... Web publications and EPUB [next version]
02:50:51 <fantasai> ... We want to read visual narratives.
02:50:57 <fantasai> ... What are visual narratives?
02:51:13 <fantasai> ... We have studied inside EDRLab a new format
02:51:18 <fantasai> ... Why a new format?
02:51:29 <fantasai> ... First, a guarantee of the visual experience as driven by the author
02:51:35 <fantasai> ... Author wants to express something in images, text
02:51:45 <fantasai> ... It must be multi-platform: want to have something that works well on native and on web
02:51:55 <fantasai> ... Simplicity of authoring
02:52:13 <fantasai> ... It would be good to have an author able to create some visual narrative, as we call it, with a simple text editor.
02:52:18 <fantasai> ... And it should work online and offline
02:52:37 <fantasai> ... Mobile first, but to accommodate digitized works based on printed works
02:52:44 <fantasai> ... Very serious about long-term preservation
02:52:59 <fantasai> ... A choice: we made a choice to work based on Web Publications
02:53:03 <fantasai> ... work done by W3C
02:53:15 <fantasai> ... You can see our work as an extension of web publication
02:53:19 <fantasai> ... It is exposed on github
02:53:40 <fantasai> ... Warning: this may hurt some web developers, because there will be no CSS, HTML, JS. JSON only
02:53:58 <fantasai> ... Please we remind we're talking about a exchange format that must be processed by both Web apps and apps with no web view
02:54:06 <fantasai> ... What we're doing is a sort of fuel for web applications
02:54:25 <fantasai> ... We're designing JSON format with what the author wants to express
02:54:31 <fantasai> ... JSON can be embedded in a web shell
02:54:43 <fantasai> ... It's extension of Web Publication Manifest as developed by W3C
02:54:54 <fantasai> ... What the web application is using, getting the novel on the screen
02:55:04 <fantasai> ... If you replace HTML/CSS/JS with something that is native, same thing
02:55:18 <fantasai> ... You can replace the JSON content get a different visual narrative that is using the same web development
02:55:36 <fantasai> ... Take what the authors want to express, make it independent of Web work, of native work
02:56:02 <fantasai> ... You don't have the same problem as exporting only HTML+CSS+JS
02:56:13 <fantasai> ... can export just JSON, or export JSOn + HTMl + CSS + JS
02:56:26 <fantasai> ... We have been focusing on the most useful effects that we find in the industry
02:56:41 <fantasai> ... Want to standardize transitions, scroll, parallax, what ?? had been talking about earlier
02:56:44 <fantasai> ... First, the model
02:56:56 <fantasai> ... Visual narrative: comics, manga, poetry, everything visual
02:57:03 <fantasai> ... It is made of pages, a step in the reading experience
02:57:12 <fantasai> ... with fragments
02:57:21 <fantasai> ... and assembled into larger units, sections
02:57:25 <fantasai> ... How implement?
02:57:34 <fantasai> ... First some JSON like a web publication manifest
02:58:09 <fantasai> ... describes reading order, images, optional resources
02:58:18 <fantasai> ... Add to this things like transitions between pages
02:58:26 <fantasai> ... Different types: crossfade, slide, wipe, split,
02:58:31 <fantasai> ... Or image sequence or animated image
02:58:38 <fantasai> ... transitions can be asymmetric
02:58:42 <fantasai> ... other priorities by the suer
02:58:52 <fantasai> ... If you look at the reading order, you see some PNG, page 1, 2, 3
02:59:10 <fantasai> ... Add some properties, a transition property for the type of transition and its parameters
02:59:22 <fantasai> ... Very easy to express with any automated tool, even with a text editor
02:59:33 <fantasai> ... Transition is animated with images, which are listed
02:59:44 <fantasai> ... If we want to express a scroll, the scroll can be vertical or horizontal
02:59:52 <fantasai> ... there will be constraints on the screen, portrait/landscape
02:59:57 <fantasai> ... there might be some scaling needed
03:00:10 <fantasai> ... author wants to position the start point
03:00:21 <fantasai> ... here are some examples
03:00:27 <fantasai> ... fit to height
03:00:37 <fantasai> ... fit tor ratio
03:00:44 <fantasai> ... If author wants to start at 50% of the scroll
03:01:05 <fantasai> ... Can put snap points at 10, 20%, etc of the scroll, can just list these positions
03:01:17 <fantasai> ... If you want to have fragment-based navigation
03:01:31 <fantasai> ... We designed it to an ordered collection of fragments to drive the navigation
03:01:38 <fantasai> ... Reuse media fragments syntax
03:01:49 <fantasai> ... We just decided that no fragment can belong to two different resources
03:02:06 <fantasai> ... If you want to do it, you must have one image, a bigger image
03:02:21 <fantasai> ... Some things which were unsuccessful in EPUB3 were due to complexity, so we tried to simplify
03:02:33 <fantasai> ... You see the href here as a media fragment URL
03:02:43 <fantasai> ... You can add a transition from the first fragment to the second one, from the second to the third
03:02:51 <fantasai> ... Ww could add more transitions, but want to keep it simple atm
03:03:00 <fantasai> ... Sections enable easy in-book-update
03:03:05 <fantasai> ... Express very simply
03:03:20 <fantasai> ... Instead of a direct reading order, have a reading order with this section
03:03:28 <fantasai> ... This section will come later, see.
03:03:36 <fantasai> ... a chapter which will be published later
03:03:39 <fantasai> ... Layers and Parallax
03:03:45 <fantasai> ... We talked about ext and image in layers
03:03:51 <fantasai> ... A page can be a collection of layers
03:03:58 <fantasai> ... A layer is an array of images (raster or vector)
03:04:12 <fantasai> ... Parallax is more complicated
03:04:33 <fantasai> ... We know that there are layers, but a speed that differs, different linear path, opacity, snap points & triggers,
03:04:44 <fantasai> ... At a certain position in the scroll, trigger a sound or some animation
03:04:50 <fantasai> ... More difficult to express but it will come soon
03:04:58 <fantasai> ... We are also studying other features, like metadata for comics
03:05:11 <fantasai> ... Alternate versions e.g. if you have something b/w and you want to go to color version
03:05:16 <fantasai> ... or from Japanese to French version
03:05:28 <fantasai> ... Multiple renditions still useful for many reasons
03:05:43 <fantasai> ... Accessibility, visual narrative in images, but you want to read it for somebody who is blind
03:05:51 <fantasai> ... Developing a native reader, it will be good using this model
03:06:02 <fantasai> ... You can do it with great performance e.g using a game engine
03:06:08 <fantasai> ... But if you are developing a web reader, you've got choices
03:06:22 <fantasai> ... ONe is DOM manipulation + (CSS or Web Animations API) + JS
03:06:34 <fantasai> ... Or you can use a canvas and just do whatever you like
03:06:48 <fantasai> ... Summary - there are narratives you can structure using JSON-LD
03:06:57 <fantasai> ... Using any kind of authoring software
03:07:03 <fantasai> ... with long term preservation in mind
03:07:17 <fantasai> ... Let developers create optimized reading engines, using the technology of today and technology of tomorrow
03:07:37 <fantasai> Subtopic: Questions, Discussions
03:08:24 <fantasai> Taro_Yamamoto: Seems to pub emphasis on interactivity on the Web. Reminds me of long tradition of ???
03:08:38 <fantasai> ... Do you think the reason is future comics have anything to do with those traditions in the past?
03:08:45 <fantasai> ... If so, what do you think we can learn from the past?
03:08:42 <dauwhe> scribenick: dauwhe
03:09:07 <dauwhe> Pablo_Defendini: interactive fiction is having a moment right now
03:09:20 <dauwhe> ... we talk a lot about tech and tools
03:09:35 <dauwhe> ... the fundamentals of how you write comics are the fundamentals, they are how you communicate
03:09:41 <dauwhe> ... they're first principles
03:09:48 <dauwhe> ... they apply regardless of technology
03:10:12 <dauwhe> RN: that's an interesting history I didn't know about
03:10:30 <dauwhe> ... now is a good time to look back at those things, when interaction touched storytelling
03:10:51 <dauwhe> ... and to come together across communities and cultures, so this current blooming is sustainable
03:11:05 <dauwhe> laurent: when we talk about interactive stories
03:11:10 <dauwhe> ... we try not to be too directive
03:11:26 <dauwhe> ... the interactivity is the reading path between states
03:11:48 <dauwhe> ... if we consider that interactivity goes further, like games, then we are in a different line of work and shouldn't go there
03:12:05 <dauwhe> RN: pages are becoming more arbitrary
03:12:13 <dauwhe> ... what is a page any more? what is a chapter?
03:12:20 <dauwhe> ... media is becoming more like cinema
03:12:29 <dauwhe> ... i'm inspired by the french turbomedia movement
03:12:49 <dauwhe> Pablo_Defendini: a page is becoming increasingly arbitrary, as you said, but there's still value there. it's a tool.
03:13:06 <dauwhe> ... you can use it as an author, you can guide stopping points
03:13:24 <dauwhe> florian: we're still exploring
03:13:36 <dauwhe> ... we see avant-garde artists creating beautiful work
03:13:47 <dauwhe> ... the following generation will learn from the inventors
03:13:55 <dauwhe> ... but they will be less deep in the technology
03:14:07 <dauwhe> ... we need authors who aren't devs to be able to do the work
03:14:23 <dauwhe> ... and think of storing some of these things as HTML or SVG doesn't seem hard
03:14:51 <dauwhe> ... for other types of work, it seems harder, but you can put images on a grid
03:15:19 <dauwhe> ... for the things Rachel showed, it is much harder to think of how to have interchangeable html
03:15:31 <dauwhe> ... but a lot could be done with HTML
03:15:51 <dauwhe> ... or we can step out of HTML like laurent did, to define something that could compile to OWP stuff
03:16:04 <dauwhe> ... do we want the web platform as authoring format, or as a delivery format?
03:16:14 <dauwhe> ... by natural inclination is to be on the web
03:16:28 <dauwhe> PD: we're getting there. there are new tools bridging that gap.
03:16:40 <kaz> q+
03:16:42 <dauwhe> ... the bridge between visual designer and front-end coder
03:16:44 <fantasai> s/to be on the web/to be on the web, but authoring tools fo the Web are *hard*/
03:16:51 <dauwhe> ... we're starting to see tools
03:17:07 <dauwhe> nmccully: I have  question about the tooling
03:17:15 <dauwhe> ... Rachel's point on open-source tooling is a good one
03:18:02 <dauwhe> ... but there's problems maintaining tools, especially when the market is small
03:18:07 <dauwhe> ... you need a community
03:18:39 <dauwhe> laudrain: I'd like to react to florian re in the web
03:18:49 <dauwhe> ... I don't see the EDRLab proposal as being out of the web
03:18:55 <dauwhe> ... it's a different layer of abstraction
03:19:02 <dauwhe> ... as an author I want to do a transition
03:19:14 <dauwhe> ... if I am in html, I need to learn css transitions
03:19:34 <dauwhe> ... but in intermediate language I can just describe my intent, and have it translated to any kind of application engine
03:20:14 <dauwhe> ... this is not comparable... we can't compare the intent of the author ... I don't want it to have to be described in JS
03:20:31 <dauwhe> ... today already it can be expressed in many ways
03:20:49 <dauwhe> Laurent: I want to insist on that. You will team with a developer.
03:21:01 <dauwhe> ... here, we want to say the developer is shared with different authors
03:21:09 <dauwhe> ... one framework for many contents
03:21:21 <dauwhe> ... it's not against the craft of building web pages
03:21:36 <dauwhe> ... if something is out of the bounds of the framework, we'll do something custom
03:22:01 <dauwhe> ... but if it's in the 80% of narratives, it will be quicker to use the framework, and it might be easier to maintain and preserve
03:22:27 <dauwhe> ... it's a different way to work, but the achievement is just the same
03:22:53 <dauwhe> RN: you mentioned the examples I showed might be beyond those existing formats
03:23:15 <dauwhe> ... I would hate to think that we are the masters of the craft already
03:23:23 <dauwhe> ... when you build tooling, you are commodification
03:23:37 <dauwhe> ... designers are being split from developers, using tools like framers
03:24:07 <dauwhe> ... we don't know what will happen next. I hope the authors of tomorrow will be inspired to do things that the tools can't do
03:24:20 <dauwhe> ... and I hope we arrange things so the specs won't be a limiting factor
03:24:49 <dauwhe> SP: to avoid a misunderstanding, what we are showing today we are not trying to do everything
03:25:01 <dauwhe> ... we are just trying to list what recurs
03:25:16 <dauwhe> ... there is tension between freedom of the web and industry, which seeks to limit production costs
03:25:36 <dauwhe> ... what we have shown today is really a step for the industry to go further
03:25:46 <dauwhe> ... it's a modest goal, with production cost always in mind
03:25:55 <dauwhe> ... I'm coming from comics paper world
03:26:14 <dauwhe> ... you have the same thing, with fanzine you do many things with original paper, silkscreen,
03:26:25 <dauwhe> ... but as a larger publisher you focus on costs
03:26:36 <dauwhe> RN: Artists like to get paid, too :) We are on your side.
03:26:55 <dauwhe> ... I want to see experimentation, but monetization has to happen quickly
03:27:12 <dauwhe> r12a: talking about monetization, we were talking about translation
03:27:18 <dauwhe> ... in Arabic/Hebrew world
03:27:34 <dauwhe> ... I imagine pages can move in different directions
03:27:47 <dauwhe> ... you can have responsible layouts that have pages move in different directions
03:28:06 <dauwhe> ... in one demo there were very narrow speech bubbles, with Japanese vertical text
03:28:27 <dauwhe> ... in another example there were simple but connected speech bubbles, that assumed a text direction
03:28:33 <dauwhe> ... is this an issue we can't get around
03:28:43 <dauwhe> ... can we use tech to get around that? even in a single frame?
03:28:52 <dauwhe> PD: I don't think it's a fundamental issue
03:28:56 <dauwhe> ... there's a tech solution
03:29:16 <dauwhe> ... you can use media queries or something, and then show proper balloon
03:29:33 <dauwhe> ... that stuff is interesting, and speaks to opportunities rather than limitations
03:29:37 <kaz> q?
03:29:50 <dauwhe> RN: I work for a large company that does lots of i18n. it can be done.
03:31:02 <dauwhe> ogata: first of all, order of frames within comics is important
03:31:14 <dauwhe> ... Japanese comics use RTL
03:31:25 <dauwhe> ... even in translation
03:31:41 <dauwhe> ... english only is LTR
03:32:16 <dauwhe> ... for a lot of people in western world are used to LTR progression
03:32:29 <dauwhe> ... so to sell to the rest of world, should be in that order
03:32:38 <dauwhe> ... but many people in the world are used to RTL
03:33:00 <dauwhe> Paolo: that should be the decision of the person creating the work.
03:33:13 <dauwhe> ... grid or flexbox would allow you to do that
03:33:25 <dauwhe> ... if you mess with the stylesheets you can do either, depending on your intent
03:33:35 <dauwhe> ... it's not a technical problem, it's a publisher-level problem
03:34:05 <dauwhe> kaz: I liked Rachel's 2D diagram, and believe there should be many topics for collaboration between published media and streaming media

05:10:40 <kaz> scribenick: fantasai
05:10:40 <kaz> Subtopic: Rich Dynamic Design with Modern CSS (Hui Jing Chen)
05:10:41 <ivan> See [slides online](https://www.chenhuijing.com/slides/41-w3c-workshop-2018/)
05:10:59 <fantasai> HJ: CSS Shapes allows floats in shapes other than rectangles
05:11:10 <fantasai> (Hui Jing Chen shows example of person cutout, with text floating around)
05:11:35 <fantasai> (Hui Jing Chen shows example of text flowing down a rabbit hole for an Alice example. It shifts with scrolling)
05:11:56 <fantasai> HJ: It gracefully falls back to rectangular float shapes when not supported in older browsers
05:12:04 <fantasai> ... Writing Modes allows vertical text
05:12:11 <fantasai> ... Alters flow of text at block and inline level
05:12:20 <fantasai> ... writing-mode property
05:12:33 <fantasai> ... text-orientation allows upright or rotated typesetting in vertical lines
05:13:00 <fantasai> ... text-combine-upright allows combining characters into a 1em space in horizontal layout (tate-chu-yoko)
05:13:31 <fantasai> ... With CSS it's possible to create a single document which can be rendered in either horizontal layout or vertical layout
05:13:53 <fantasai> ... CSS logical properties makes this easier, the same code for margins, padding, borders will work in both writing modes
05:14:09 <fantasai> ... A question in QA was about laying out content in different directions
05:14:22 <fantasai> ... Combination of writing-mode and/or flex-direction can determine the flow of content on your page
05:14:31 <fantasai> ... The content does not need to flow top-to-bottom
05:14:45 <fantasai> ... writing-mode changes the flow of text
05:15:02 <fantasai> ... Flex directions allow changing just the ordering of a set of boxes
05:15:12 <fantasai> ... Can go left to right, right to left, top to bottom, even bottom to top
05:15:20 <fantasai> ... and wrap into multiple lines
05:15:32 <fantasai> ... Another major development is CSS Grid
05:15:48 <fantasai> ... Has been supported stably in major browsers for over a year
05:15:58 <fantasai> ... Allows placing items into a grid, and even allows overlap
05:16:39 <fantasai> ... It is easy to lay out elements on top of each other, and can use blend modes, transparency, and clip paths to create interesting overlapping effects.
05:16:57 <fantasai> ... Placing items on a page becomes as straightforward as placing items on a chessboard
05:17:15 <fantasai> ... and can be made flexible to stretch and fit different window sizes
05:17:35 <fantasai> ... Media queries allows significant changes in layout for different ranges of window sizes
05:18:02 <fantasai> ... Responsive images is another feature which loads different images, or different resolutions of the same image, based on the available space and screen resolution
05:18:37 <fantasai> ... Viewport units can be used to size items to a percentage of the viewport
05:19:00 <fantasai> ... Media queries can also choose between different aspect ratios, so layouts can be fluid within a range, but also be rearranged based on the orientation of the window.
05:19:18 <fantasai> ... Thank you

05:20:00 <fantasai> dauwhe: I went to my first W3C meeting  in 5 and a half years ago
05:20:16 <fantasai> ... Workshop on print, met Håkon and Bert and other mythical figures in CSS
05:20:47 <fantasai> ... 5 yrs ago I went to another W3C workshop in Paris
05:20:59 <fantasai> ... I worried that Web would be dominated by frameworks
05:21:04 <fantasai> ... TOld to go to China next month for TPAC
05:21:17 <fantasai> ... 5 years later at another w3c workshop , what has changed in 5 years?
05:21:28 <fantasai> ... Jen Simmons describes history of web as going through phases
05:21:38 <fantasai> ... no design,flash, fluid layout, fixed-width layout, responsive design, intrinsic design
05:21:43 <fantasai> ... But as publishers we can't just start using grid today
05:21:48 <fantasai> ... First of all, our content is very big
05:21:59 <fantasai> ... Here's a blog post that includes the entire text of Moby Dick in a single web page
05:22:11 <fantasai> ... this image was Tokyo Tower , i.e. 170m tall image
05:22:20 <fantasai> ... Usability demands that we present content in more digestible pieces
05:22:26 <fantasai> ... print and epub use pieces called pages
05:22:34 <fantasai> ... In epub world we can't use a lot of modern web capabilities
05:22:46 <fantasai> ... in original kindle, couldn't even put top margin and left margin on the same element
05:23:04 <fantasai> ... In spite of the best efforts of ppl in this room, big divide between world of publishing and world of the web
05:23:13 <fantasai> ... As publisher, I'm afraid to use parts of CSS even from 2.1
05:23:26 <fantasai> ... These are print book sizes (shows rectangles)
05:23:47 <fantasai> ... On the web, can change the size of the page in a second. In print world, takes 6 months to a year
05:23:53 <fantasai> ... In my day job, set books in CSS
05:24:00 <fantasai> ... Usually works ok< but there are some exceptions
05:24:05 <fantasai> ... This book, for example, has annotations.
05:24:10 <fantasai> ... But annotation themselves have annotations
05:24:18 <fantasai> ... We had to redesign this layout when we did the print
05:24:25 <fantasai> (Dave shows examples from David Foster Wallace)
05:24:33 <fantasai> dauwhe: We never did an ebook of this one, because we couldn't figure out how
05:24:42 <fantasai> ... Tried some experiments with grid, but many reading systems don't support this
05:24:50 <fantasai> ... So stuck doing same simple things with ebooks
05:25:04 <fantasai> ... This is a choose your own adventure novel, called Chose Your Own Disaster
05:25:12 <fantasai> ... I made it more disastrous by setting right-to-left
05:25:15 <fantasai> ... But simple isn't easy.
05:25:20 <fantasai> ... It's more fun to talk about animations, shapes, exclusions
05:25:30 <fantasai> ... But there's still a lot of fundamental work to do in typography
05:25:37 <fantasai> ... in ways that apply to books, print, and web
05:25:47 <fantasai> ... Books have pages, to help not hurt the reader
05:25:54 <fantasai> ... But sometimes things paginate badly
05:26:05 <fantasai> ... Some breaks are ... , like at beginning of chapter
05:26:08 <fantasai> ... Others are contextual
05:26:16 <fantasai> ... Try to avoid breaking in bad places
05:26:23 <fantasai> (Dave quotes from Chicago Manual of Style)
05:26:27 <fantasai> dauwhe: Don't remove title from a section, e.g.
05:26:36 <fantasai> ... Need to describe when it's ok to split things up, when it's ok
05:26:42 <fantasai> ... Browsers not very good at it currently
05:26:55 <fantasai> ... But publishers are very aware of these problems
05:27:01 <fantasai> ... My goal is to teach these things to browsers
05:27:07 <fantasai> ... Many types of breaks
05:27:28 <fantasai> ... Even a single line can break badly, ends up typeset too tight or too loose wen justified
05:27:33 <fantasai> ... We don't have much control over justification
05:27:47 <fantasai> ... Here's another problem, a short partial word at the end of the paragraph
05:27:54 <fantasai> ... This is not great, various approaches to fixing it
05:28:06 <fantasai> ... Would be really useful to have things like hyphenation exception dictionaries
05:28:12 <fantasai> ... and other ways of solving problems
05:28:23 <fantasai> ... Also have problems breaking pages
05:28:30 <fantasai> ... Here is a widow, single line stranded at the top of the page
05:28:45 <fantasai> ... CSS has a 'widows' property, to pull down another line of text so it's not alone
05:28:56 <fantasai> ... But that breaks a more fundamental rule, that spreads should have the same height on both pages
05:29:20 <fantasai> ... In this example, typesetter fixed that problem by tweaking a paragraph so that it wraps to an extra line
05:29:27 <fantasai> ... Even on a larger scale, we want to optimize chapters
05:29:33 <fantasai> ... WE don't want a chapter to end with one line of text
05:29:48 <fantasai> ... Also see that kind fo thing that on the Web, you have a page with a scrollbar and it scrolls to expose one word.
05:29:57 <fantasai> ... Or disclosure triangle exposing just one word, or one or two calendars
05:30:05 <fantasai> ... Sometimes think on scale of entire books
05:30:31 <fantasai> ... Books are printed on giant sheets of paper, cut and folded to create a book
05:30:37 <fantasai> ... So only certain multiples of pages are OK
05:30:48 <fantasai> ... There's another level of optimization we don't know how to do yet
05:31:05 <fantasai> ... On the Web scale, have milliseconds to redo a layout
05:31:14 <fantasai> ... If I have a few days, like in print world, can do some nice fixes
05:31:19 <fantasai> ... Slow books
05:31:28 <fantasai> ... Thank you
05:32:07 <fantasai> Subtopic: The Versatile Web (Myles C Maxfield)
05:32:12 <ivan> See [slides online](https://w3c.github.io/tokyo18-workshop/slides/Myles.pdf)
05:32:24 <fantasai> MM: I'm an engineer on Webkit, member of CSS Working Group
05:32:31 <fantasai> ... The Web is incredibly powerful, can do a huge number of things
05:32:37 <fantasai> ... Go through a walking tour of amazing things it can do
05:32:59 <fantasai> ... Layout modes to describe your content layout, typography, internationalization, responsive design
05:33:06 <fantasai> ... CSS Grid — it's really easy to get it to work
05:33:17 <fantasai> ... Put display grid on your content, and your content will participate in a grid
05:33:25 <fantasai> (Myles shows off some examples from Jen Simmons)
05:33:35 <fantasai> MM: There are additional properties that control spacing and positioning, but very straightforward
05:33:51 <fantasai> ... Flexbox is similar, lines up items along an axis, can control spacing and sizing
05:34:07 <fantasai> ... Multicolumn is also super easy: ask for number of columns, or preferred width of columns
05:34:16 <fantasai> ... You can add this property
05:34:31 <fantasai> ... CSS properties are additive, you can combine them together
05:34:46 <fantasai> ... You can describe content in SVG,
05:35:05 <fantasai> ... Letters in this green bar are described as vector images, always sharp. Looks great on Retina device
05:35:24 <fantasai> ... Can use SVG to make infographics, diagrams, etc. using basic geometrical shapes
05:35:32 <fantasai> ... MathML allows typesetting math equations
05:35:43 <fantasai> ... Line Grids are something that have been around since dawn of history
05:36:03 <fantasai> ... CSS proposal creates a grid with a signal declaration, asks lines to snap to grid
05:36:14 <fantasai> ... Shapes allows content to flow around non-rectangular shapes
05:36:24 <fantasai> ... Can choose a polygon, or draw a shape, or use an image
05:36:37 <fantasai> ... exclusions are similar to shapes, but can put in the middle of your content
05:36:57 <fantasai> ... Most of these things are additional properties, can have e.g. multicol layout with exclusions
05:37:02 <fantasai> ... So typography
05:37:09 <fantasai> ... Complex text shaping is done: browser just handles it
05:37:23 <fantasai> ... ::First-letter allows styling the first letter
05:37:34 <fantasai> ... Can turn first line of content into small-caps
05:37:40 <fantasai> ... drop-caps with `initial-letter` property
05:37:52 <fantasai> ... combining e.g. `::first-letter { color: red; initial-letter: 4; }`
05:38:03 <fantasai> ... Hanging punctuation
05:38:32 <fantasai> ... The browser has knowledge about the language (if you mark it up) so can figure out correct set of rules to use
05:39:01 <fantasai> ... Hyphenation is similar, `hyphens: auto` turns on hyphenation using correct dictionary
05:39:10 <fantasai> ... widows/orphans control are another set of setting
05:39:17 <fantasai> ... font-features allow improving typographic quality
05:39:29 <fantasai> ... Here are some examples: font-variant: diagonal-fractions, small-caps,
05:39:59 <fantasai> ... font variations mean you don't have to choose between font-weight: 600 and 700, can use 697 if you want
05:40:12 <fantasai> ... fill and stroke allow outlines on text, etc.
05:40:20 <fantasai> ... can load color fonts
05:41:01 <fantasai> ... Internationalization ... RTL text just works, can set base direction with HTML `dir` attribute
05:41:15 <fantasai> ... Writing modes allows top to bottom right to left, or top to bottom left to right
05:41:47 <fantasai> ... Ruby markup allows ruby annotations, 'ruby-position' to change which side of the text
05:41:52 <fantasai> ... text-emphasis can add dots
05:42:16 <fantasai> ... Everything I talked about here are additional CSS properties that the browser uses
05:42:23 <fantasai> ... They all work together to create sophisticated layouts
05:42:33 <fantasai> ... All of these are controllable conditionally, using media queries
05:42:42 <fantasai> ... Can switch from a grid layout to a flex layout
05:42:52 <fantasai> ... or totally change layout between screen and print
05:42:56 <fantasai> ... change colors
05:43:01 <fantasai> ... disable animations
05:43:03 <fantasai> ... etc.
05:43:37 <fantasai> ... Relative units, media queries work great for discrete positions, but you can change the line height based on the browser window width, using more spacing for wider measures fluidly and automatically
05:43:51 <fantasai> ... CSS variables
05:43:59 <fantasai> ... Browser makes these features work seamlessly together, and that's what we do
05:44:52 <fantasai> Subtopic: Auto Font Alternating System (Satoko Takahasi)
05:45:36 <ivan> See [slides online](https://w3c.github.io/tokyo18-workshop/slides/20180918AutoFont_DNP.pdf)
05:45:49 <fantasai> Satoko_Takahasi: Automatically use fonts to express text better
05:45:57 <fantasai> ... Useful for printing but also for web and ebooks
05:46:04 <fantasai> ... Typefaces are important for communication
05:46:12 <fantasai> ... DNP research and development on typography
05:46:17 <fantasai> ... Created font alternating system
05:46:24 <fantasai> ... Firstly, I like to talk about the system function
05:46:38 <fantasai> ... The system can automatically replace font according to topics of users's feeling
05:46:51 <fantasai> ... For example, if I have tender words, display in rounded sans-serif typeface
05:47:03 <fantasai> ... If I have Japanese topics, I can display in Japanese calligraphic typeface
05:47:17 <fantasai> ... This shows an image that the system uses on messenger
05:47:22 <fantasai> ... Left picture is regular system, basic font
05:47:33 <fantasai> ... right picture is using our system, it is displayed in different fonts
05:47:38 <fantasai> ... Next I like to talk about system features
05:47:50 <fantasai> ... Just one, the system does this users motion from the sentence
05:48:01 <fantasai> ... Also judges user's feelings from emoticons
05:48:08 <fantasai> ... Users can also choose other fonts
05:48:15 <fantasai> ... If the system suggests a font, also users can choose another font
05:48:22 <fantasai> ... You can edit each word to activate auto replacement on the system
05:48:29 <fantasai> ... I'd like to show a demonstration
05:48:36 <fantasai> ... We developed a prototype of the system
05:48:53 <fantasai> (Satoko Takahasi demonstrates by typing some words, automatically changed to different font)
05:49:07 <fantasai> Satoko_Takahasi: I type a word, happy
05:49:15 <fantasai> ... I type about sushi
05:49:27 <fantasai> ... I type about horror movie
05:49:37 <fantasai> ... If you want to see more demonstrations, you can watch a movie on youtube
05:49:58 <fantasai> ... This shows the font list that the system is using
05:50:08 <fantasai> ... System uses 12 fonts
05:50:13 <fantasai> ... Chooses which word to replace with which font
05:50:21 <fantasai> ... Here is example in English
05:50:26 <fantasai> ... Next I'd like to talk about practical application
05:50:34 <fantasai> ... This shows that image of the system used in chatbot
05:50:41 <fantasai> ... THe system gives more humanity to the chatbot
05:50:57 <fantasai> ... This shows that the image the manga-style messenger, using word balloons with different styles
05:51:04 <fantasai> ... If the system used in ebook creation program
05:51:24 <fantasai> (Satoko Takahasi shows example of before/after the system for a manga panel)
05:51:34 <fantasai> Satoko_Takahasi: Basic font is replaced with more stylized one
05:52:30 <fantasai> Subtopic: Questions, Discussions
05:53:00 <fantasai> Florian: Not really a question, but a comment
05:53:14 <fantasai> ... Many things in the presentations we saw now reminded me of what Jen Simmons said
05:53:32 <fantasai> ... Florian: In print, we draw pretty things, decide exactly what the user sees
05:53:52 <fantasai> ... In the web, it is more like a sculpture. You can fully design the document, you do not chose how the reader decide to view the document. But we are still in control.
05:54:08 <fantasai> ... The designer doesn't choose *one* view: designs many views
05:54:26 <kaz> q+
05:54:34 <fantasai> ... reader decides how they are going to read, but author has not lost control, controlling different aspects
05:55:07 <fantasai> Kaz: I tend to agree with Florian
05:55:13 <fantasai> ... Thank you very much for your presentation.
05:55:19 <fantasai> ... was wondering about emotion features for publishing
05:55:32 <fantasai> ... we have some W3C specifications dedicated to marking up emotions etc.
05:55:48 <fantasai> ... How to handle and how to record emotion information
05:55:52 <fantasai> ... what bout combining emotions?
05:55:59 <fantasai> ... partly angry partly happy?
05:57:00 <fantasai> ... My point I think is actual human doesn't have completely one emotion, can be kind of angry, kind of happy, kind of confused, kind of disgusted
05:57:07 <fantasai> ... That kind of combination
05:57:47 <dauwhe> https://www.w3.org/TR/emotionml/
05:58:23 <fantasai> kaz: (in Japanese) there is a standard to express mixed feelings (e.g. 20% surprised, 80% happy), which could be used as input to the dynamic font system
05:59:03 <fantasai> TY: I'm very interested in this area of emotion expression and font substitution
05:59:23 <fantasai> ... But this type of technology implies, the mapping from one emotive expression such as angry anger or something to some font style
05:59:29 <fantasai> ... This is one to one mapping
05:59:48 <fantasai> ... On the side of the recipient, according to the mapping selected by the system, the font style is chosen and displayed on recipient side
06:00:18 <fantasai> ... But in order for this to be successful, the mapping itself should be based on common set of mapping relationships
06:00:26 <fantasai> ... Should be commonly understood
06:00:41 <fantasai> ... The context of the mapping and semantic relationships should need to be commonly understood on both sides consistently
06:00:52 <fantasai> ... otherwise emotive intent will not be correctly understood
06:01:07 <fantasai> ... For example, you say I wanted to have sushi.
06:01:13 <fantasai> ... The semantic is mapping to a style or font
06:01:22 <fantasai> ... But I think maybe, he wants to have sushi now
06:01:39 <fantasai> ... But what on the recipient side now, from notion of sushi might be different depending on place you live
06:01:50 <fantasai> ... Sentence in Kansai, you may imagine a kansai style sushi
06:02:01 <fantasai> ... but recipient maybe lives in Tokyo, and imagines Tokyo style sushi
06:02:37 <fantasai> ... So it is necessary for us to be able to evaluate faithfully, to what degree of fidelity, the intended semantic of a context can be conveyed from the sender to the recipient
06:02:50 <fantasai> ... I think there will be many vague and difficult things, issues included in this kind of technology
06:03:02 <fantasai> ... About this kind of difficulty I have now, I can imagine what do you think about this.
06:04:51 <fantasai> Satoko_Takahasi: Difficult to express... of course it's true that when sender sees something, and what other person gets might be different
06:04:59 <fantasai> ... After awhile sender might feel something else
06:05:17 <fantasai> ... Kind of experiment, throw a stone and see what happens. What kind of help to express this kind of emotion
06:05:35 <fantasai> TY: Too difficult to answer everything here but we should continue discussing it
06:05:49 <fantasai> Ivan: I want to come back to the point Florian made at the beginning, about CSS-related things
06:05:57 <fantasai> ... will play devil's advocate
06:06:15 <fantasai> ... Each of them is super easy, but as a user of CSS am overwhelmed.
06:06:37 <fantasai> ... When I hear Dave say that there are certain elements of CSS2 that he's afraid to use... if he can't use it, I don't want to touch it
06:06:46 <fantasai> ... Level of complexity that CSS has today that is frightening
06:06:52 <fantasai> ... You see new modules coming up once a week
06:07:04 <fantasai> ... I don't know where it ends, and how anyone can grasp its entirety
06:07:23 <fantasai> ... Many things you can rely on them
06:07:33 <fantasai> ... No publisher can rely on MathML today. There is no reliable implementation.
06:07:40 <fantasai> ... Some browsers ignore it, some have partial implementation..
06:08:03 <fantasai> ... you spoke about hyphenation. I cannot rely on it, because not supported across the board
06:08:13 <fantasai> ... problem in the higher level things, don't know how to manage it
06:08:26 <fantasai> ... In this community, it's a big problem
06:09:00 <fantasai> dauwhe: CSS2.1 comment was because epub reading systems are often homemade layout engines or are hacking the layout system so much that stuff breaks
06:09:15 <fantasai> ... That's not the fault of CSS, but result of how reading systems have evolved
06:09:57 <fantasai> MM: Because it has developed over decades and is additive, and can have progressive enhancement. DOn't have to have it all in your head.
06:10:07 <fantasai> ... There are many pieces to the Web platform. Many implementations, not all support everything
06:10:15 <fantasai> ... Every implementation would like to support everything but we haven't gotten there yet
06:10:33 <fantasai> HJ: Agree, you don't need to know every of the 503 properties we have now to get something to work
06:11:02 <fantasai> ... If you're reluctant to support properties because unsure of support, CSS offers feature query -- `@supports` rule -- to make some declarations conditional on support
06:11:07 <fantasai> ... View of digital as a platform
06:11:21 <fantasai> ... underlying view that we're trying to push forward is that the design doesn't have to look the same on every device
06:11:28 <fantasai> ... You give your user multiple perspectives on the same content
06:11:35 <fantasai> ... it is medium for transmission of content
06:11:49 <fantasai> ... Not practical expectation for medium like the web to look the same on every device
06:12:16 <fantasai> ... It is much safer than before to use newer CSS properties to worry that lack of support to break your design, because means and methods to ensure that a decent experience can be had across any device regardless of whether old or new
06:12:24 <fantasai> ... to re-iterate Myles's point, you don't have to learn all of it to use it
06:12:41 <fantasai> ... I'm in the same boat about browser support
06:12:53 <fantasai> ... e.g. I looked at hyphens, it is supported everywhere except Opera Mini
06:13:01 <fantasai> ... Flexbox and Grid were quickly adopted by all browsers
06:13:32 <fantasai> Florian: Did you mark up the language?
06:13:39 <fantasai> Ivan: Yes, but it wasn't French, it was Hungarian (all languages are different)
06:14:16 <fantasai> ... In general, I understand all that, but nevertheless, we have a problem if it becomes very difficult for an average designer who is not deeply into the technology
06:14:27 <fantasai> ... to understand what is going on
06:14:42 <fantasai> ... Get a partially-designed site from someone else, try to change/improve it
06:15:01 <fantasai> ... Maybe it's a documentation issue, but something bothers me, that makes it overly complex
06:15:13 <fantasai> Florian: Won't try to pretend CSS is very simple. Many properties, lots of moving parts
06:15:22 <fantasai> ... But in another sense CSS has become simpler
06:15:38 <fantasai> ... We were in the past abusing CSS features that were not designed for what we're trying to do, to build very complex layouts
06:15:48 <fantasai> ... Using floats and line heights and inline-block and all kinds of stuff to make this work
06:15:56 <fantasai> ... It was very hard, and had to teach each other complicated tricks
06:16:09 <fantasai> ... But it is no longer necessary, can directly express desired layouts in Flexbox and Grid
06:16:17 <fantasai> ... Doing the same designs in Flexbox/Grid is much simpler
06:16:30 <fantasai> ... So tools are more complicated, but answers to design problems are much simpler
06:16:42 <fantasai> Bobby: I remember being very excited that drop-cap was implemented by Webkit
06:16:50 <fantasai> ... Finally it works, great to work with CSS
06:17:05 <fantasai> ... but actually many systems were developed many years ago
06:17:26 <fantasai> ... If one browser implements it, others will follow suit, but it's more complicated for epub reading systmes
06:17:54 <fantasai> ... So publishers will be concerned to publish epub files with minimal typography, will not want to use latest features because it's not safe
06:18:05 <fantasai> dauwhe: I like the idea of having the computer do the work
06:18:16 <fantasai> RA: To follow up from what Florian says
06:18:23 <fantasai> ... I've been teaching CSS for 19 years now
06:18:30 <fantasai> ... what we're gettin now is much more consistent models, esp. layout
06:18:39 <fantasai> ... And that's making things an awful lot easier
06:18:59 <fantasai> ... I can get students to do in a day is way ahead than what I could do 5 years ago
06:19:14 <fantasai> ... So much easier than using tools not designed to do layout to do layout
06:19:30 <fantasai> ... For ppl using CSS for a long time it's actually harder to learn, because have to unlearn first.
06:19:38 <fantasai> ... But for new people, the basics are actually much easier now.
06:19:54 <fantasai> Laurent: About reading systems that don't implement CSS correctly
06:20:09 <fantasai> ... Some reading systems are built from scratch. Have to implement all of CSS
06:22:36 <fantasai> ... Some of the older reading systems that have poorly-compliant rendering engines may have significant market share/
06:20:37 <fantasai> ... Some reading systems built on a Web engine, and they implement all of CSS
06:20:50 <fantasai> ... So everything built on Readium and many other engines are using 100% CSS
06:21:01 <fantasai> ... So one can not say that most reading systems don't implement CSS, most do.
06:21:23 <fantasai> dauwhe: Also different markets have different mixes of implementations
06:21:34 <fantasai> ... Using webkit from 5 yrs ago is much different from Webkit from Last week
06:22:01 <fantasai> r12a: I understand where Ivan is coming from, you're more deeply involved in CSS
06:22:16 <fantasai> ... There are new things that really simplified my life, but have to learn it
06:22:33 <fantasai> ... Documentation is a big deal. I remember learning CSS and trying to figure things out
06:22:49 <fantasai> ???: You go from one tutorial to another, where's the place where I can go to look at the spec, it's not really friendly for learning
06:23:07 <fantasai> Rachel_Nabors: Role of design systems in CSS means that individual designers don't kneed to learn all of CSS
06:23:16 <fantasai> ... Design specialists build much, and others re-use
06:23:36 <fantasai> ... You see this in open source frameworks. We're not rewriting CSS from scratch every single time. Collaborative system, each person does what they do best
06:24:02 <fantasai> Florian: Combination of CSS is easier due to better layout, and also progressive enhancement is good
06:24:19 <fantasai> ... In the past, doing an advanced design was a pile of hacks. If any piece didn't work, everything broke.
06:24:31 <fantasai> ... With new capabilities, can have better graceful degradation.
06:24:53 <fantasai> ... Because using features in way that they were intended, the fallback is not as nice but is not totally broken
06:25:00 <fantasai> ... your content will still be there and be readable
06:25:41 <fantasai> Florian: Ruby is a good example. _If_ system supports ruby, get ruby annotations. If not support ruby, get parenthesized annotations. Not as nice, but it still works
06:26:11 <fantasai> Luc move to EPUB 3, better typography than EPUB2.
06:26:19 <fantasai> ... But take example of initial-letter, only in one browser engine
06:26:38 <fantasai> ... How long do we wait for interesting specifications to be deployed, for features that are important to publications?
06:26:45 <fantasai> ... It's a difficulty for us
06:26:59 <fantasai> ... Though we do our best effort to promote CSS as being more and more powerful, we have this difficulty
06:27:16 <fantasai> ... Another point, CSS works because of a programmer, an algorithm that applies.
06:27:26 <fantasai> ... I don't know if this algorithm is specified anywhere
06:27:28 <fantasai> ... Probably not
06:27:35 <fantasai> ... We don't speak about this
06:27:45 <fantasai> ... For the same CSS there may be some differences, because the engines are different
06:27:51 <fantasai> ... I don't know if there's some work in W3C
06:28:05 <fantasai> Florian: initial-letter, yes, still missing from most browser
06:28:17 <fantasai> ... But if you're trying to build a document with CSS and trying to use initial letter
06:28:33 <fantasai> ... the reader may not see initial letter in one case, but the document is still there
06:28:48 <fantasai> ... Maybe you don't like that it's not there, you use the alliterative: make JPEg of your page
06:28:56 <fantasai> ... But then it's unreadable on a phone because text is too tiny
06:29:05 <fantasai> ... You can't control everything, but you get adaptability
06:29:13 <fantasai> ... Second question about algorithms, yes, this is what the CSSWG does.
06:29:34 <fantasai> ... Our job is to specify the features in extremely precise detail so that the implementations will all be the same
06:29:51 <fantasai> ... If there are differences, we investigate and make the spec more precise
06:30:00 <fantasai> ... to get the browsers to align
06:30:10 <kaz> q?
06:30:21 <fantasai> Florian: if there is a point of non-interop, and the spec is ambiguous, then tell us, we will fix it. That's our job in the CSSWG.
06:30:30 <fantasai> koji: there is difference between browser world and epub world
06:30:43 <fantasai> ... In browser world, there is some pressure to implement new features
06:30:58 <fantasai> ... e.g. caniuse database, competing with other browsers to match what they implement
06:31:05 <fantasai> ... or in bug system, get requests for a features from developers
06:31:11 <fantasai> ... but epub reader world, there is no such thing
06:31:18 <fantasai> ... maybe W3C community can improve this
06:31:37 <fantasai> ... create database to show which reading system uses which version of which engine, supports which features
06:31:55 <fantasai> ... encourage users, reading system devs, to update these systems
06:32:04 <fantasai> dauwhe: Testing is the big elephant in the room
06:32:10 <fantasai> ... For EPUB 3, there was only manual testing
06:32:32 <fantasai> ... There are 50-60 different reading system, behaviors vary from platform to platform
06:32:39 <fantasai> ... EPUB community group is very aware of this
06:32:53 <fantasai> ... What to put much more effort on testing and documentation, and encourage systems to support more of the spec
06:33:01 <fantasai> koji: It's not possible for any single person to create all this data
06:33:17 <fantasai> ... Need to create an ecosystem, get vendors to participate, to encourage vendors to implement new properties
06:33:26 <fantasai> dauwhe: Have had discussions with Web Platform Tests people
06:33:37 <fantasai> ... would love to run all the HTML/CSS tests on epub systems automatically, but a lot of work to be done there
06:33:47 <laudrain> q?
07:01:58 <fantasai> Topic: Internationalization Concerns
07:01:58 <fantasai> Subtopic: Internationalization at W3C (Richard Ishida)
07:01:58 <ivan> See [slides online](https://www.w3.org/International/talks/1809-tokyo/)
07:02:28 <fantasai> r12a: The internationalization activity at w3c, called i18n for short
07:02:42 <fantasai> ... We believe that the importance of the Web for all people of all countries of all languages
07:02:50 <fantasai> ... Work is divided into three areas
07:02:59 <fantasai> ... Language enablement -- to understand where gaps are for suers of the global web
07:03:07 <fantasai> ... Developer support - build standards and apps
07:03:24 <fantasai> ... We have recently started the W3C Internationalization Initiative
07:03:37 <fantasai> ... Two goals, one to increase participation in W3C from underrepresented regions
07:03:49 <fantasai> ... Second, to increase sponsorship of i18n activities at w3c
07:04:06 <fantasai> ... We have some some sponsorships already, APL from Japan, Monotype, Paciello Group, and Alibaba Group
07:04:11 <fantasai> ... Language enablement
07:04:20 <fantasai> ... Here are some of the things we're currently doing, going to focus mostly on here
07:04:23 <fantasai> ... Language enablement
07:04:30 <fantasai> ... This is a fairly new thing, a language matrix
07:04:49 <fantasai> ... Across the top we have a number of categories of typographic features, such as line breaking, justification, etc.
07:04:55 <fantasai> ... Down the side we ave a list of languages
07:05:02 <fantasai> ... Want to note problems in supporting these languages
07:05:19 <fantasai> ... Figure out features that need to be developed for CSS or SVG, provide the typographic information needed
07:05:28 <fantasai> ... From the current state, we have 32 languages that need work
07:05:35 <fantasai> ... for advanced publishing
07:05:45 <fantasai> ... Orange squares, 25, need work for basic features
07:05:52 <fantasai> ... 2 language that just don't work well on the Web at all
07:05:59 <fantasai> ... 47% still need investigation
07:06:12 <fantasai> ... So we're trying to find experts, to get the information of where we stand in supporting a _World Wide_ Web
07:06:22 <fantasai> ... We started this work a long time ago with teh Japanese Language Requirements document
07:06:36 <fantasai> ... Develop a document that was not technology-specific, to simply describe how Japanese typesetting works
07:06:43 <fantasai> ... Then follow that approach for other langauges
07:06:55 <fantasai> ... Since then we have developed Hangul klreq, Chinese clreq
07:07:04 <fantasai> ... Arabic alreq, Ethiopic elreq ongoing
07:07:20 <fantasai> ... We have Indic ilreq, and I wrote a first draft of Tibetan tlreq
07:07:28 <fantasai> ... Breaking news is new Mongolian mlreq
07:07:37 <fantasai> ... Still need more help for all of these
07:08:03 <fantasai> ... These documents take awhile, and it's a lot of work. Not much happens in the meantime
07:08:19 <fantasai> ... So earlier this year, we had a rethink, and decided to produce a different doc, a gap analysis
07:08:25 <fantasai> ... Here's the Japanese Gap Analysis
07:08:47 <fantasai> ... Idea is to look at for a particular set of languages, how each of these typesetting requirements to see what's supported, what still needs work
07:08:50 <fantasai> ... And to prioritize
07:08:54 <fantasai> ... both spec work, testing and implementations
07:09:09 <fantasai> ... Squares in Japanese, you can see it takes you to the proper place in Japanese layout gap analysis
07:09:21 <fantasai> ... Can see how problem is solved, unsolved.
07:09:26 <fantasai> ... Figure out which is high priority items
07:09:39 <fantasai> ... I expect that in the future, more piecemeal progress
07:09:57 <fantasai> ... The next step, we still weren't getting enough participation in these activities
07:10:05 <fantasai> ... Third is networks
07:10:11 <fantasai> ... Example is Southeast Asian Task Force
07:10:14 <fantasai> ... We had nothing
07:10:23 <fantasai> ... The main thing was to gather experts, and ask them questions
07:10:45 <fantasai> ... We can see questions relevant to CSS, or other things, to get answers and have discussions, figure out necessary changes e.g. to CSS specs
07:11:00 <fantasai> ...Intend to roll this out to other task forces
07:11:14 <fantasai> ... People who participate in these task forces, get a notification relevant to their task force
07:11:21 <fantasai> ... Also have started tagging CSS issue and HTML issues and so on
07:11:35 <fantasai> ... If there are changes to such issues, also get notifications for those
07:11:38 <fantasai> ... Have an issue tracker
07:11:50 <fantasai> ... You can see a summary, can filter it to show what are the questions we have about Mongolian
07:12:01 <fantasai> ... As it happens, the SE Asian TF is documenting some stuff
07:12:13 <fantasai> ... We have a Khmer Gap Analysis, Lao Gap Analysis, Javanese Gap Analysis
07:12:36 <fantasai> ... More breaking news, put a new Japanese Language Task Force infrastructure
07:12:58 <fantasai> ... To work on JLREQ errata, to publish new informative documents, create Japanese gap analysis, discuss issues
07:13:09 <fantasai> ... You can get involved as a follower or as a contributor
07:13:21 <fantasai> ... The amount of work needed is can be very small
07:13:32 <fantasai> ... Also needed a place to find the information that's accumulating, so creating a text layout index
07:13:58 <fantasai> ... Each section talks about a typesetting aspect and links to requirements docs, other resources, spec links, tests, etc.
07:14:17 <fantasai> ... Also have a type samples repo, anyone can submit samples of typography in the wild
07:14:40 <fantasai> ... We also do Developer Support
07:14:53 <fantasai> ... We review specifications at W3C, send comments to specification working groups
07:15:09 <fantasai> ... We track those comments to make sure spec editors receive the advice they need, resolve the issues we have.
07:15:22 <fantasai> ... We have spec development guidelines to help spec editors remember to accommodate i18n
07:15:37 <fantasai> ... and a self-review checklist to help them check on common i18n requirements
07:15:54 <fantasai> ... In development is how to transfer information about base direction in data format like JSON
07:16:04 <fantasai> ... We also have a number of articles, for content authors predominantly
07:16:09 <fantasai> ... Of how to sue internationalization tools
07:16:14 <fantasai> ... Here's an example of vertical text
07:16:34 <fantasai> ... On the righthand side you'll see notes on whether things work in various browsers or not, other useful info for authors
07:16:44 <fantasai> ... We also have test suites, and results of those tests in major browsers
07:16:51 <fantasai> ... Again, we have a techniques index
07:17:03 <fantasai> ... Can drill down and find information on how to do things
07:17:22 <fantasai> ... We have an i18n checker, quickly check if you have made errors or other problems. Link to more information on how to fix
07:17:28 <fantasai> ... So, to finish, next steps
07:17:47 <fantasai> ... We need to widen participation of experts in langue requirement groups
07:17:54 <fantasai> ... Significantly increase scope and output of language enablement
07:18:05 <fantasai> ... Extend i18n test framework to support tests and paged media

07:19:29 <ivan> See [slides online](https://w3c.github.io/tokyo18-workshop/slides/bomofo.pdf)
07:19:35 <fantasai> BT: What is Bopomofo?
07:19:49 <fantasai> ... It is a phonetic system for Mandarin education in Taiwan, and a major input method for Han characters
07:20:04 <fantasai> ... it is typically written alongside Han characters, like Japanese kana ruby
07:20:12 <naomi> naomi has joined #tokyows
07:20:19 <fantasai> ... Rules for bopomofo are published online, if you want to learn
07:20:25 <fantasai> ... (see [https://bit.ly/2w3LEph](https://bit.ly/2w3LEph))
07:20:40 <fantasai> ... want to talk about how to achieve the correct layout
07:20:53 <fantasai> ... HTML can mark up bopomofo correctly
07:21:05 <fantasai> ... But positioning of characters, particularly tone marks, is problematic
07:21:23 <fantasai> ... There are several variants of markup, the best one for accessibility only supported by Firefox
07:21:27 <fantasai> ... We have some issues
07:21:35 <fantasai> ... Tone marks are encoded into Unicode
07:21:57 <fantasai> ... Noto Hans Sans and Helvetical include these code points in their fonts
07:22:10 <fantasai> ... How to position tone marks in horizontal writing...
07:22:18 <fantasai> ... Tone marks are very small, but it's hard to read for readers here
07:22:27 <fantasai> ... Vertical writing, the note mark should move to the side
07:22:39 <fantasai> ... in some cases before the syllable
07:22:49 <fantasai> ... I was told in CSSWG that the tone marks position should be built with OpenType features
07:23:00 <fantasai> ... When found a good way, bring back to CSSWG for next step
07:23:22 <fantasai> ... But I don't know anything about opentype. Don't know what opentype feature should be used. Do we make a sample font for that? Should we add new features to OpenType for those?
07:23:29 <fantasai> ... add browser feature for that?
07:24:15 <fantasai> ... Somebody from Mozilla found the issue, harfbuzz OpenType engine fixed, and now works in Firefox
07:24:42 <fantasai> ... But not others, so went and asked other experts for help...
07:24:57 <fantasai> ... You can see, this is almost done. In vertical writing, tone marks are in the correct position
07:25:09 <fantasai> ... We also received feedback from WikiMedia community in Taiwan
07:25:21 <fantasai> ... They want to ...
07:25:29 <fantasai> ... Recently we got everything done, so you can check the github repo
07:25:40 <fantasai> ... We also filed bugs for Webkit, Blink, Edge
07:25:44 <fantasai> ... You can see case numbers
07:26:02 <fantasai> ... Dr. Ken Lunde from Adobe allow me to say that next version of Noto Sans and ?, will improve those features
07:26:16 <fantasai> ... That's great because these fonts are widely-used open license fonts for Chinese
07:26:23 <fantasai> ... Conclusions, font issues are outside W3C
07:26:30 <fantasai> ... If there are font issues, don't know where to handle
07:26:42 <fantasai> ... Should we have a font community group to liaison with CSSWG and OpenType etc.?
07:26:49 <fantasai> ... Could we solve other CJK issues in the same way?
07:27:09 <fantasai> ... For example,  Every 5 years I come to Japan we talk about Kanbun issue, but no progress on it
07:27:30 <fantasai> ... How to publish the solution in a standardized way, should it be an i18n note? Something else?
07:27:38 <fantasai> ... Need browsers to see this information
07:27:46 <fantasai> ... Many thanks for everyone who helped this project
07:28:05 <fantasai> ... Thank you.
07:28:09 <fantasai> Subtopic: Questions, Discussions
07:28:32 <fantasai> MM: Richard, you said two languages don't work well on the Web. Which two are they?
07:28:50 <fantasai> r12a: Might be 1.5, actually. ONe of them was Mongolian, and the reason I put that because the ? model ??
07:29:09 <fantasai> ... We're not quite sure yet. there's no completely interoperable set of variants across fonts (???)
07:29:12 <fantasai> ... So that's a half
07:29:17 <fantasai> ... The other one is Javanese
07:29:34 <fantasai> ... where they break lines on orthographic syllables, involves stacks and other things
07:30:00 <fantasai> ... and browsers don't know how to deal with that. Since no spaces, text runs off the right hand side of the page
07:30:05 <fantasai> ... Those are the two I've found so far
07:30:40 <fantasai> MM: Why did you choose to use font features to solve tone mark problem, rather than other technology?
07:31:05 <fantasai> BT: People in the CSSWG gave this advice
07:31:30 <fantasai> ... Ask Japanese community, for me main layout issue for Taiwanese was bopomofo. Wanted to figure out what is the next issue to work on.
07:31:40 <fantasai> ... tategaki was most important, but it's almost done
07:31:54 <fantasai> ... What's the *next* most important issue for Chinese + Japanese typesetting, that we need to solve in W3C?
07:34:19 <fantasai> fantasai: Wanted to first say thank you very much for following through on this issue of tone mark placement. It was not straightforward, and I am very impressed at how well you followed through to make sure it worked.
07:34:34 <fantasai> ... secondly wanted to answer question of why this is a font feature not a layout feature.
07:35:07 <fantasai> Florian: Wanted to address issue of font community group. yes, we need a better liaison with font groups
07:35:27 <fantasai> ... Often in CSSWG we realize there is some problem with OpenType format, or with how fonts are implemented, but we don't know how to follow up
07:35:39 <fantasai> ... e.g. we are missing some baselines that we need to do initial-letter properly
07:35:52 <kaz> q?
07:36:00 <fantasai> Makoto: OpenType spec is maintained by Adobe and Microsoft
07:36:19 <fantasai> kaz: Thank you very much for your presentation
07:36:35 <fantasai> ... I don't disagree with your approach, have a similar question to Myles
07:36:46 <fantasai> ... but, for example, [Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/) has mechanism to handle additional metadata like pronunciation and tones
07:37:03 <fantasai> ... Maybe think about how to deal with pronunciation and metadata in addition to how to express the font would be useful
07:37:59 <fantasai> ... ruby Bopomofo with right tone marks is correct for accessibility
07:37:59 <fantasai> ... SSML 1.1 can use bopomofo or IPA pronunciation alphabet :)
07:39:46 <fantasai> Topic: Accessibility Concerns
07:39:46 <fantasai> Subtopic: When AI enters publishing process... (Vincent Wartelle)
07:39:46 <ivan>See [slides online](https://w3c.github.io/tokyo18-workshop/slides/ISIcrunch_PPT_W3C-Tokyo_v4.pdf)
07:40:05 <fantasai> VW: I was asked by ? to talk about the new project, artificial intelligence in publishing process
07:40:07 <kaz> s/have a/but have a/
07:40:33 <fantasai> ... We'll talk about the ebook communication. We are fully committed to ebooks, creating epubs for education publishers
07:40:39 <fantasai> ... Production of ebook community
07:40:50 <fantasai> ... We'll see challenges and goals, why we chose AI
07:41:07 <fantasai> ... Just a background, we're very happy to see that the digital textbooks or digital books should continue to grow
07:41:10 <fantasai> ... as I mentioned
07:41:15 <r12a-fallback> r12a-fallback has joined #tokyows
07:41:26 <fantasai> ... But more happy to see textbooks, much more important. In France for example it's 38% growth
07:41:54 <fantasai> ... Means use of digital textbooks is a growing market, and we have need of a lot of production features, because very specific market
07:42:16 <fantasai> ... Our platform, we take a PDF, make EPUB 3 with HTML and CSS. We have application to insert interactivity
07:42:27 <fantasai> ... Textbooks have a lot of external resources for exercises etc.
07:42:36 <fantasai> ... But ...
07:42:47 <fantasai> ... Rich interactive ebooks.
07:42:51 <fantasai> ... Proofing process
07:42:56 <fantasai> ... Studio underlies the AI system
07:43:06 <fantasai> ... Summarize, we focus on education, use epub3, fixed layout, and production
07:43:09 <fantasai> ... Upcoming needs.
07:43:24 <fantasai> ... We produce for French education publishers since 2013
07:43:37 <fantasai> ... smartphone market, especially emerging market, is something to handle in the future
07:43:46 <fantasai> ... high demand for individual resources.
07:43:58 <fantasai> ... Not enough to just have the book, can create a lot of resources from the book as well
07:44:14 <fantasai> ... Need to build new service, Resources Database
07:44:24 <fantasai> ... of resources to freely reuse by teachers and government
07:44:43 <fantasai> ... Last we have to extend the usage to disable audience. Education means education for everyone
07:44:50 <fantasai> ... So we have to address accessibility.
07:44:56 <fantasai> ... It's very difficult to do that in the old fixed layout
07:45:32 <fantasai> ... When you reach education book, read in spreads, beautiful design work should be respected
07:45:54 <fantasai> ... easy to automate, easy to add interactivity
07:46:15 <fantasai> ... Problem we face is, because it is display-orientated based on the print world, really difficult to adapt to mobile. Not accessible, not at all. And not content-aware.
07:46:24 <fantasai> ... Delivers a lot of content, but...
07:46:34 <fantasai> ... That's why we began to create what we call Hybrid EPUB
07:46:39 <fantasai> ... Just show a sample of that
07:46:50 <fantasai> ... This is a book in our reading app
07:46:54 <fantasai> ... This is an automatic book
07:46:57 <fantasai> ... Two-page spreads
07:47:08 <fantasai> ... we have something similar to a reflow system on top of spreads
07:47:19 <fantasai> ... Inside a section of the page, that we've captured, zoom into a reflow view
07:47:26 <fantasai> ... You can have text, and you can also have images
07:47:45 <fantasai> ... But this here is a formula... rendered as an image.
07:48:03 <fantasai> ... This is done manually, and this is the problem actually.
07:48:22 <fantasai> ... So goals for tomorrow
07:48:34 <fantasai> ... We build a reflow production plan
07:48:40 <fantasai> ... Need to produce 300-400 books in 3 months time
07:48:48 <fantasai> ... Books tend to be ready very very late, and need to deliver by September
07:48:54 <fantasai> ... Need to be as responsive as possible
07:48:58 <fantasai> ... Need to be accessible ready
07:49:03 <fantasai> ... Semantics should be rich as well
07:49:09 <fantasai> ... And of course has to be cost-effective.
07:49:15 <fantasai> ... This is why the answer is AI
07:49:22 <fantasai> ... We use Ai to help us build such a system.
07:49:31 <fantasai> ... What we need to achieve, we need to know what we have.
07:49:39 <fantasai> ... Things like this, we have simple boxes which separate text from image
07:49:58 <fantasai> (Vincent shows a page with photos and some text in various areas, rectangles drawn around each and categorized as text box or image box)
07:50:06 <fantasai> VW: You could also define boxes with semantic view on the page
07:50:09 <fantasai> ... boxes within boxes
07:50:29 <fantasai> ... you can drill into boxes, define boxes to extend between exercise instruction and image which is illustrative of exercise
07:50:34 <fantasai> ... Second output is define classes
07:50:44 <fantasai> ... Classes mean defining semantics, able to capture using analysis
07:50:51 <fantasai> ... This is a simple branch of the page before
07:50:58 <fantasai> ... Then you have to use different algorithm to do that.
07:51:05 <fantasai> ... first is object detection, some already well-known algorithms
07:51:12 <fantasai> ... Then we have semantic segmentation, which uses FCN
07:51:22 <fantasai> ... We have instance segmentation which is a mix of the 2 previous models
07:51:26 <fantasai> ... and we have a natural language process.ing
07:51:42 <fantasai> ... E.g. we need to understand the words in the instructions, because, e.g. it links to another resource.
07:51:59 <fantasai> ... E.g. instructions says "listen to ...", need to know that this links to another resource
07:52:10 <fantasai> ... Third point is to set up mixed data sets.
07:52:15 <fantasai> ... We have more than 1 million images
07:52:26 <fantasai> ... We think we need another data set, which is web scraping.
07:52:42 <fantasai> ... Some websites are very relevant for our algorithm, because they are already structured
07:52:47 <fantasai> ... and is similar to our research
07:52:51 <fantasai> ... Database of exercises
07:53:03 <fantasai> ... Would be interesting to see what is full range of exercises used in education
07:53:09 <fantasai> ... We could use similar data sets as ?
07:53:25 <fantasai> ... It should not be exactly images of education book, but maybe ? or ? would be interesting to analyze
07:53:43 <fantasai> ... So the team now, project started in July and team includes Data scientist which come from different background
07:53:52 <fantasai> ... specialist of data learning
07:54:01 <fantasai> ... We've made some integration of research laboratory
07:54:11 <fantasai> ... we work with ??? which is the atomic energy research center in France
07:54:16 <fantasai> ... and keen on data visualization
07:54:26 <fantasai> ... We have ? which work on data analysis
07:54:36 <fantasai> ... And of course team of developers, which build the whole system to create a future
07:54:49 <fantasai> ... So the roadmap that we have in mind is preliminary study that we've already started
07:54:54 <fantasai> ... running datasets
07:55:02 <fantasai> ... framework validation should be expected ...
07:55:11 <fantasai> ... We're thinking to enter production in 24 months
07:55:25 <fantasai> ... Thanks to our first clients éditions didier

07:57:00 <fantasai> JC: Want to be able to index the content of comics
07:57:11 <fantasai> ... The content of manga and french bandes dessinées
07:57:29 <fantasai> ... The content has much text and graphics
07:57:35 <fantasai> ... However, descriptions are usually very semantically poor
07:57:50 <fantasai> ... Publishers only provide some minimal metadata: title, author, editor
07:57:59 <fantasai> ... Very difficult to provide wide description of the content
07:58:10 <fantasai> ... It is very time consuming, and no rule sin the publishing standards for semantic information.
07:58:33 <fantasai> ... It could be interesting to have better access to the content
07:58:43 <fantasai> ... We need to extract semantic content from comics,
07:58:48 <fantasai> ... Why? New devices allow new interactions
07:58:57 <fantasai> ... We can now have interaction with the user. We need tools.
07:59:02 <fantasai> ... But we need to index precisely the content
07:59:13 <fantasai> ... If we have to do that for each new album, it takes too much time.
07:59:21 <fantasai> ... can we automatically do this?
07:59:25 <fantasai> ... THis is what we tried to do.
07:59:33 <fantasai> ... Comic books, it's not a trivial problem
07:59:50 <fantasai> ... Each type have completely different styles, and each author has own styles and own way to draw the characters
07:59:58 <fantasai> ... So we have extra information, graphical information, everything is important
08:00:17 <fantasai> ... Even for the text, we have many different presentations styles of text
08:00:42 <fantasai> ... Develop some ??? using AI and machine learning to understand the content to index the content
08:00:51 <fantasai> ... So, we have begun to look at this topic 7 yrs ago
08:01:06 <fantasai> ... Here we have basic element extraction
08:01:11 <fantasai> ... Al this information can be used
08:01:17 <fantasai> ... Want to understand the content of the panel
08:01:27 <fantasai> ... We have to figure out how to recognize the text, so full text indexing
08:01:33 <fantasai> ... We are able to detect the reading order
08:01:40 <fantasai> ... succession of each
08:01:47 <fantasai> ... Can create link between speech balloon and the character
08:01:58 <fantasai> ... We try to recognize the character. Who is this?
08:02:11 <fantasai> ... 5th, try to recognize the object or place of action. Is it in Tokyo? Somewhere else?
08:02:22 <fantasai> ... So this research concern both digitized comics
08:02:30 <fantasai> ... We have many comics we can digitize, so what can we do ?
08:02:42 <fantasai> ... Other comics are specifically created for digital
08:02:47 <fantasai> ... We have some different approaches
08:02:53 <fantasai> ... To be able to solve problems
08:03:14 <fantasai> ... Figure out difference in style, e.g. between American comics, mangas, bandes dessinée
08:03:35 <fantasai> ... We need a very rich language for description,to have keyword searches and interactions with the user on new devices
08:04:01 <fantasai> ... These three are kind of format are able to index the parts of the comics
08:04:14 <fantasai> ... Three examples are ComicsLM
08:04:21 <fantasai> ... we decided to use them to index
08:04:31 <fantasai> ... Comic Book Markup Language was proposed by John Walsh in 2012
08:04:44 <fantasai> ... Description language using XML syntax
08:04:54 <fantasai> ... CBML
08:05:15 <fantasai> ... Here is the example of a representation of this page
08:05:51 <fantasai> ... So description is able to describe the text and the author
08:06:03 <fantasai> ... and we have some description of the whole page. Here is another one.
08:06:16 <fantasai> ... You can see the captions and balloons
08:06:31 <fantasai> ... Description of the balloon who is speaking, etc.
08:06:46 <fantasai> ... We have some tags to describe basic elements of the comic: panel, balloon, character,
08:06:53 <fantasai> ... We also have some drawbacks
08:07:00 <fantasai> ... Description is purely semantic
08:07:04 <fantasai> ... No information on location of hte items
08:07:12 <fantasai> ... Idea was to manually describe the content of the comics
08:07:22 <fantasai> ... Also not possible to describe all the elements
08:07:31 <fantasai> ... So we have to add some information
08:07:44 <fantasai> ... Here we add information about the face, where is it
08:07:59 <fantasai> ... in the panel
08:08:10 <fantasai> ... If you want to display a double page, reading direction, etc.
08:08:18 <fantasai> ... Well understood the content of the page
08:08:24 <fantasai> ... We nee to know this information
08:08:33 <fantasai> ... Drawbacks of CBML, it has been created to describe digitized contents
08:08:44 <fantasai> ... But born-digital contents, there are several layers, and sometimes short animation
08:08:57 <fantasai> ... For which uses?
08:09:11 <fantasai> ... Can create panel by panel reading for any document
08:09:29 <fantasai> ... improve text-to-speech, braille translation, enhancing contrast of the text, or ad color of text for dyslexic people
08:09:49 <fantasai> ... What you can do is t create services between reader and content, e.g. provide contextual information on character, place
08:10:02 <fantasai> ... But we need to extract the maximal information to make this possible
08:10:09 <fantasai> ... And we need a standard to describe all this information.
08:10:13 <fantasai> ... Conclusion,
08:10:17 <fantasai> ... content of comics is rich
08:10:26 <fantasai> ... New devices offer more opportunities
08:10:46 <fantasai> ... Automatic analysis is needed, but need to develop specific algorithms based on AI and machine learning
08:10:55 <fantasai> ... Need a standard to index correctly the comics

08:13:04 <fantasai> Florian: I would like to answer the first question.
08:13:17 <fantasai> ... There's a CSS module not about describing the visual layout, but also the audio rendering
08:13:22 <fantasai> ... You can choose which voice, etc.
08:13:30 <fantasai> ... The model is reasonably complete, but nobody has implemented it
08:13:53 <kaz> q?
08:14:34 <fantasai> kamae: It's an idea and we're thinking about it. For now we're going to detect some characters. The next step is to organize the characters,
08:14:41 <fantasai> ... Describe this one is a woman, child, etc.
08:14:55 <fantasai> ... We can imagine that we can do this, but we are not there yet.

08:15:32 <fantasai> ... How to indicate that capability?
08:15:46 <fantasai> Ivan: It it something that's also implemented? Comes back to what Florian said
08:15:59 <fantasai> ... CSS has Speech module, but is kind of old capability but not really maintained
08:16:14 <fantasai> ... SSML 1.1 is not really maintained in CSS

08:16:28 <fantasai> kaz: Yes. Via speech api
08:16:58 <fantasai> Ivan: The reason I'm asking that is, as I said sometime today, what we do now we realize that audio books is something newer that web applications handle well
08:17:05 <fantasai> ... We need to add something to make that usable
08:17:16 <fantasai> kaz: How to integrate that with data publishing
08:17:20 <fantasai> Ivan: Something we need to discuss
08:17:40 <fantasai> ?: We work with a company called ???, we have developed an API between rendering, automatic incorporation into EPUB3, etc.
08:17:55 <fantasai> ?: you have a feature which could say, this want to be spoken by a man, this one by a female. We use this already
08:18:20 <fantasai> Kamae: We do something like this, but ideally when in a comic there are two guys or even girls fighting each other, sometimes like to mix two voices together

00:05:40 <dauwhe> Murakami: I am Shinyu Murakami from Vivliostyle
00:05:49 <dauwhe> ... my topic is CSS typesetting,
00:06:37 <dauwhe> ... My slides are in HTML, and are an example of vivliostyle. It's not fixed layout, it's reflowable
00:06:56 <dauwhe> ... here's the table contents with page numbers via CSS generated content
00:07:07 <dauwhe> ... as the font size changes the page numbers change as the presentation gets longer
00:07:18 <dauwhe> ... my background: developing typesetting languages
00:07:31 <dauwhe> ... I developed XTR, a text formatter, in the early 1990s
00:07:49 <dauwhe> ... I worked for AntennaHouse for 15 years, supporting both XSL-FO and CSS
00:08:17 <dauwhe> ... now I work for Vivliostyle on CSS typesetting
00:08:26 <dauwhe> ... CSS is print formatting of publications via CSS
00:08:37 <dauwhe> ... there is dedicated software, some using browsers and some not
00:08:43 <dauwhe> ... many books are already made
00:08:53 <dauwhe> ... technical books from O'Reilly Media
00:09:20 <dauwhe> ... this article by Sanders Kleinfield shows how they work, using AntennaHouse formatter
00:09:42 <dauwhe> ... the Japanese version of Lea Verou's CSS Secrets book was done with Vivliostyle
00:10:04 <dauwhe> ... the layout is entirely html and css
00:10:29 <dauwhe> ... Dave Cramer of Hachette uses CSS typesetting for trade books
00:10:37 <dauwhe> ... and wrote about this on XML.com
00:11:04 <dauwhe> ... manuals and catalogs are produced with CSS typesetting
00:11:12 <dauwhe> ... these often use AntennaHouse formatter
00:11:22 <dauwhe> ... another example is Wiley online journals
00:11:34 <dauwhe> ... here's a sample using Vivliostyle
00:12:00 <dauwhe> ... there are several CSS typesetting engines which convert HTML to PDF
00:12:44 <dauwhe> ... the main commercial products are Prince, PDFReactor, AntennaHouse, and Versa-Type of Trim-marks Inc. (name changed from Vivliostyle)
00:12:51 <dauwhe> ... Open Source engines include
00:12:55 <dauwhe> ... WeasyPrint
00:13:06 <dauwhe> ... Vivliostyle, which I work on, started with vivliostyle foundation
00:13:37 <dauwhe> ... page.js, a new open-source project from pagedmedia.org
00:14:11 <dauwhe> ... some formatters are based on browsers
00:14:29 <dauwhe> ... they have the advantage of having browser support for most css standards
00:15:25 <dauwhe> ... responsive or adaptive design is possible
00:15:41 <dauwhe> ... houdini APIs can be used to make next-generation engines
00:15:56 <dauwhe> ... but support for print and PDF is not good
00:16:17 <dauwhe> ... quality is poor
00:16:23 <dauwhe> ... there are problems with font embedding
00:17:11 <dauwhe> ... can't embed open type/CFF fonts; they are embedded as type 3, which are not usually accepted by printing houses
00:17:26 <dauwhe> ... they are limited to RGB color, instead of CMYK
00:17:44 <dauwhe> ... due to subpixel rendering, Chrome cannot output thin border (less than 1px)
00:18:01 <dauwhe> ... and they do not support PDF standards like PDF/X1 or PDF accessibility
00:18:31 <dauwhe> ... on the other hand, CSS typesetting engines that do not use browser engines have incompatibilities in which paged media drafts they support
00:18:48 <dauwhe> ... Pagination on the web needs to be standardized
00:18:57 <dauwhe> ... scroll vs pagination should be a user choice
00:19:21 <dauwhe> ... in pagination mode, same page layout spec as printing should be used
00:19:25 <dauwhe> ... thank you!
00:20:13 <dauwhe> Subtopic: New Tools for CSS Layout (Rachel Andrews)
00:20:13 <ivan> See [slides online](https://noti.st/rachelandrew/tJeWKI/new-tools-for-css-layout)
00:20:20 <dauwhe> RA: a bit about me
00:20:27 <dauwhe> ... I do web stuff
00:20:30 <dauwhe> ... I'm a webdev
00:20:37 <dauwhe> ... I've done a lot of teaching and writing about CSS
00:20:50 <dauwhe> ... and I get feedback from webdevs back to the CSSWG
00:21:00 <dauwhe> ... I want to introduce the major layout methods on the web today
00:21:27 <dauwhe> ... we talk a lot about flexbox and grid, but we have other layout modes
00:21:40 <dauwhe> ... and other concepts that brought things together
00:22:08 <dauwhe> ... the problem today is helping people get past the old hacks
00:22:15 <dauwhe> ... that we now have an actual system
00:22:28 <dauwhe> ... we've got flexbox, for layout in one dimension , a row OR column
00:23:16 <dauwhe> ... which depends on writing mode
00:24:07 <dauwhe> ... alignment in flexbox is about distribution of space
00:25:43 <dauwhe> ... we're thinking about logical directions, rather than left or right
00:26:16 <dauwhe> ... flex is useful even to center single items in both dimensions
00:26:33 <dauwhe> ... Flexbox came along first, and people thought it would solve everything
00:26:49 <dauwhe> ... but people tried to use flex to make grids, as people had tried to use floats before
00:26:52 <dauwhe> ... and that was fragile
00:27:05 <dauwhe> ... but now we have CSS grid, for proper two-dimensional layout
00:27:16 <dauwhe> ... in rows and columns
00:27:39 <dauwhe> ... the things you learn from flex carry over from grid, like box alignment
00:27:52 <dauwhe> ... grid allows layout on block and inline axis at the same time
00:28:07 <dauwhe> ... you define grid on a parent
00:28:24 <dauwhe> ... here we're using the fr unit
00:28:46 <dauwhe> ... the direct children of the grid container become grid items
00:29:29 <dauwhe> ... be sure to use the firefox grid inspector if you work on this
00:30:10 <dauwhe> ... the same alignment properties I used with flex work for grid, too
00:30:20 <dauwhe> ... like justify-content and align-content
00:30:54 <dauwhe> ... note I'm using inline-size and block-size rather than width and height, so we can easily change writing modes
00:31:53 <dauwhe> ... the alignment properties give you a consistent way of aligning things, whether in one or two dimensions
00:33:31 <dauwhe> ... this is a true system for layout!
00:33:37 <dauwhe> ... for the first time.
00:33:52 <dauwhe> ... flex, grid, multicol have consistent sizing, they all use box alignment
00:33:58 <dauwhe> ... you can create a design system
00:34:12 <dauwhe> ... this element should be flex, this one should be grid... and they can all line up.
00:34:17 <dauwhe> ... it makes my job easier.
00:34:37 <dauwhe> ... CSSWG is now working on subgrids for level 2 of grid
00:34:43 <dauwhe> ... I've written an article on subgrid
00:34:51 <dauwhe> ... what's next?
00:35:00 <dauwhe> ... logical properties and values
00:35:15 <dauwhe> ... Firefox has the best support at the moment
00:35:46 <dauwhe> ... what's next? Box alignment in block layout.
00:36:14 <dauwhe> ... and I want to know what's important to you?
00:36:22 <dauwhe> ... I think regions is a missing piece
00:36:30 <dauwhe> ... what are you struggling with? what hasn't been solved yet?
00:36:41 <dauwhe> ... all my examples and code are at the URL on the slide.
00:36:45 <dauwhe> ... thank you!
00:37:31 <dauwhe> Subtopic: Designing CSS (Elika Etemad)
00:37:31 <ivan> See [slides online](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/designing-css/#title)
00:37:43 <dauwhe> fantasai: I'm on the CSSWG for the last 14 years
00:38:03 <dauwhe> ... I'm going to talk about designing CSS, rather than designing with CSS
00:38:10 <dauwhe> ... I've worked on a lot of specs :)
00:38:20 <dauwhe> ... we have some principles of web architecture
00:38:29 <dauwhe> ... 1. web is cross-device and cross-platform
00:38:45 <dauwhe> ... it should adapt to screens, braille, terminals, print, speech, etc.
00:39:08 <dauwhe> ... it should adapt to lores, highres, big screens little screens
00:39:22 <dauwhe> ... it needs to be cross-platform.
00:39:36 <dauwhe> ... it should adapt to Mac, Linux, Windows, mobile OSs, etc
00:39:47 <dauwhe> ... it has to work on multiple implementations
00:40:01 <dauwhe> ... it should work on gecko, presto, trident, webkit, servo...
00:40:15 <dauwhe> ... new tech for the web should work on multiple browser architectures
00:40:31 <dauwhe> ... it has to work with different input devices--mouse, keyboard, voice...
00:40:39 <dauwhe> ... 2. The web is the world-wide web
00:40:54 <dauwhe> ... it needs to work for all writing modes, all languages, and handle hybrids
00:41:01 <dauwhe> ... like mixing languages in documents
00:41:30 <dauwhe> ... we might not mix Mongolian and Hebrew, but we do see Arabic and Chinese quite a bit
00:41:57 <dauwhe> ... 3. It must be forward and backward compatible
00:42:12 <dauwhe> ... it needs to be forward-compatible with future features
00:42:22 <dauwhe> ... adding new stuff shouldn't break existing implementations
00:42:31 <dauwhe> ... forwards-compatible parsing
00:42:42 <dauwhe> ... so you just discard stuff you don't understand when parsing
00:42:57 <dauwhe> ... if you don't recognize things, just skip over it and keep going
00:43:06 <dauwhe> ... and we have levels not versions
00:43:46 <dauwhe> ... the web has one format, which are decades old
00:44:04 <dauwhe> ... we can add features, we can refine slightly, but we can't change existing stuff because it would BREAK THE WEB
00:44:21 <dauwhe> ... 4. No Data Loss
00:44:52 <dauwhe> ... our goal is by default you see all the things
00:45:01 <dauwhe> ... visible by default, readable by default
00:45:10 <dauwhe> ... 5. Separation of content and style
00:45:20 <dauwhe> ... html for content and structure, css for presentation
00:45:34 <dauwhe> ... css is a bunch of annotations on the html
00:45:37 <dauwhe> ... why?
00:45:53 <dauwhe> ... efficiency. putting font tags on every page takes a long time. We tried that and it wasn't fun
00:46:03 <dauwhe> ... maintenance. better to fix things in only one place.
00:46:19 <dauwhe> ... memory and bandwidth. extracting common elements into a single file avoids repetition
00:46:46 <dauwhe> ... accessibility. this allows better support for speech and search; the semantics don't get distorted by styling considerations
00:47:21 <dauwhe> ... variability. you can change your design over time.
00:47:38 <dauwhe> ... your blog might go through five redesigns, but you don't have to touch the markup
00:47:44 <dauwhe> ... how do we do this?
00:47:57 <dauwhe> ... we thing about what parts of rendering are structure
00:48:20 <dauwhe> ... here's an example from ruby
00:49:55 <dauwhe> ... where we can use CSS to choose between different methods of displaying ruby, although the underlying annotation markup is the same
00:50:25 <dauwhe> ... here's CSS Zen Garden from a long time ago, which demonstrated the separation of content and style
00:50:35 <dauwhe> ... and people submitted different styles for the same content
00:51:11 <dauwhe> ... so these five premises are our foundation
00:51:22 <dauwhe> ... our fundamental goal is accessibility of information
00:51:41 <dauwhe> ... constraints of CSS
00:52:06 <dauwhe> ... you're designing a layout size where you don't know the display size or orientation, you might not know the content, or the fonts, or the language
00:52:31 <dauwhe> ... you need to create beautiful layouts with no post-processing
00:52:45 <dauwhe> ... so we have design principles
00:52:55 <dauwhe> ... 1. Flexible. They can't be based on fixed sizes.
00:53:15 <dauwhe> ... 2. Powerful. We want interesting layouts that help us understand complex information
00:53:39 <dauwhe> ... 3. Robust. It should't break if something goes wrong, like a missing font
00:53:52 <dauwhe> ... 4. Understandable.
00:54:04 <dauwhe> ... 5. Performant. This pages are loading in real time.
00:54:19 <dauwhe> ... how do we do that?
00:54:28 <dauwhe> ... here's an example of multi-col layout
00:54:58 <dauwhe> ... you can say you want two columns
00:55:19 <dauwhe> ... or you can say the columns can be a certain width, and the browser makes as many columns as will fit
00:55:26 <dauwhe> ... you could limit the max number
00:56:11 <dauwhe> ... here are initial letters, where there's a lot of calculation but you want it simple for the author
00:56:16 <dauwhe> ... so we use font metrics
00:56:30 <dauwhe> ... and we make sure we avoid overlap
00:56:38 <dauwhe> ... we use automatic sizes in CSS
00:56:53 <dauwhe> ... here's Jen Simmon's reinterpretation of an old graphic poster
00:57:03 <dauwhe> ... but her version is adaptable to different sizes
00:57:27 <dauwhe> ... with min-content and max-content and auto
00:57:32 <dauwhe> ... design pitfalls of CSS
00:57:36 <dauwhe> ... 1. Iterative layout
00:57:42 <dauwhe> ... 2. Unsolvable constraints
00:57:47 <dauwhe> ... 3. Expensive algos
00:57:51 <dauwhe> ... 4. data loss
00:57:57 <dauwhe> ... challenges: shape inside
00:58:16 <dauwhe> ... what happens if you have text inside. what happens if the font gets bigger. How do you avoid overflow?
00:58:26 <dauwhe> ... exclusions have a similar problem
00:58:39 <dauwhe> ... where a cycle may be created
00:59:37 <dauwhe> ... we want to do regions, but the current proposals require empty elements, which violates separation of content and style
01:00:05 <dauwhe> ... the initial grid layout had overlap problems, but we figured out something different which met CSS's design criteria
01:00:29 <dauwhe> ... one web for all.
01:01:23 <dauwhe> Subtopic: Advanced CJK typography, from DTP to Web Layout (Nate McCully)
01:01:41 <dauwhe> nmccully:  I work for Adobe Systems
01:01:50 <dauwhe> ... I'm going to talk about advanced CJK typography
01:01:57 <dauwhe> ... and give some background
01:02:31 <dauwhe> ... if your goal for web and css rendering is accessibility and legibility you might not be interested in what I'm saying, because we've accomplished that
01:02:54 <dauwhe> ... but there's been lots of evolution in CSS, the expression of art in the presentation of text and images
01:03:00 <dauwhe> ... the goals are shifting and changing
01:03:20 <dauwhe> ... we can worry about details now
01:03:48 <dauwhe> ... CSS gives us lots of cool controls over layout
01:04:01 <dauwhe> ... why are so few Japanese websites taking advantage of them?
01:04:16 <dauwhe> ... what is it about graphic design in japan that makes it difficult to do in HTML/CSS?
01:04:41 <dauwhe> ... maybe the level of detail is difficult for CSS?
01:04:44 <dauwhe> ... Let's look at some examples
01:05:06 <dauwhe> ... I googled beautiful web design
01:05:57 <dauwhe> ... but this site is not particularly beautiful
01:06:02 <dauwhe> ... with horrendous typography
01:06:17 <dauwhe> ... it's the lowest common denominator
01:06:34 <dauwhe> ... here's a site for hot springs
01:06:46 <dauwhe> ... where the print brochures are very high-design
01:06:57 <dauwhe> ... but on the web it looks great, but it's images not life text
01:07:20 <dauwhe> ... and the text has some problems--horizontal comma in vertical writing, for example
01:07:46 <dauwhe> ... so I asked a friend, who pointed me to a different site
01:07:55 <dauwhe> ... which has much better vertical text
01:08:20 <dauwhe> ... but each thing is a span, with lots of negative letter spacing
01:08:31 <dauwhe> ... and it reminded me of desktop publishing in the 1990s
01:09:00 <dauwhe> ... in Quark and InDesign, every run of text had be hand-kerned
01:09:12 <dauwhe> ... because the programs didn't support Japan's design language
01:09:18 <dauwhe> ... so we set out to fix that
01:09:22 <dauwhe> ... we've been here before
01:09:28 <fantasai> http://sosus.co.jp/
01:09:31 <dauwhe> ... so we can learn about what the web can do
01:09:45 <dauwhe> ... in the 90s, DTP still lacked critical features
01:09:49 <fantasai> https://tadaya.net/
01:09:51 <dauwhe> ... the fonts had problems
01:10:03 <dauwhe> ... everything used roman baselines
01:10:09 <dauwhe> ... origin was in the wrong place
01:10:40 <dauwhe> ... Grid layout in DTP
01:11:37 <dauwhe> ... there was an exchange of ideas between Euro and Japanese grid systems
01:11:58 <dauwhe> ... but the grid systems in DTP software wasn't good enough to do what phototypesetting operators in japan were doing
01:12:16 <dauwhe> ... they were using the em-box
01:12:40 <dauwhe> ... there was an offset from the bottom of the embox to the roman baseline, which caused trouble with digital fonts
01:13:41 <dauwhe> ... we looked at people in Japan using proprietary systems what they used
01:14:00 <dauwhe> ... they showed us a grid based on body-text sizes, so there was an implicit character grid
01:14:14 <dauwhe> ... everything else is sized relative to the character grid
01:14:19 <dauwhe> ... the units were in millimeters
01:14:45 <dauwhe> ... or units that would convert to mm (q)
01:15:05 <dauwhe> ... so there needs to be a way to express design in emboxes
01:15:13 <dauwhe> ... DTP evolved
01:15:40 <dauwhe> ... it's all about control of white space
01:16:40 <dauwhe> ... even the initial opening dialog in InDesign which asked for margins did not help people. the margins came from the design, not before the design
01:16:55 <dauwhe> ... here's some calligraphy, which says "steep cliff" and you can see it in the calligraphy
01:17:42 <dauwhe> ... the interplay of space is very important
01:18:14 <dauwhe> ... I'm interested in history, and so looked for analogs from before typesetting
01:18:43 <dauwhe> ... even ads today have very focused white space, following a set of rules which are NOT ascent/descent/baseline
01:19:28 <dauwhe> ... we don't yet have consistency between browsers
01:19:48 <dauwhe> ... the designer needs to express their intent as input to the algorithm
01:20:15 <dauwhe> ... every result must be faithful to the design, which means we need better layout algorithms and standards
01:20:54 <dauwhe> ... and there are still missing components
01:21:21 <dauwhe> ... like having actual Japanese font metrics rather than using latin metrics
01:21:44 <dauwhe> ... thank you!
01:22:27 <dauwhe> Subtopic: Questions, Discussions
01:22:37 <dauwhe> Laurent: re: paged media
01:22:45 <dauwhe> ... we are readium developers
01:22:54 <dauwhe> ... we have to do dynamic pagination for EPUB in reflow mode
01:23:16 <dauwhe> ... CSS paged media we would like to use it, but we can't because there's uneven support of the technology in the browsers
01:23:31 <dauwhe> ... no support for size property in paged media, for example
01:23:40 <dauwhe> ... so in readium we use multicol to paginate
01:23:52 <dauwhe> ... and the implementations are flowed, especially for i18n
01:24:10 <dauwhe> ... we can't stack pages horizontally in vertical writing, except in safari
01:24:35 <dauwhe> ... but we don't see much movement from the browsers
01:24:48 <dauwhe> ... we want publications to be first-class citizens of the web
01:25:09 <dauwhe> ... but we need some basic features evenly in all browsers, and CSS paged media is one of the technologies, along with grid and flex
01:25:33 <dauwhe> ... we need implementations too
01:25:42 <dauwhe> fantasai: I agree :)
01:25:58 <dauwhe> ... the problem is that most browser devs are not excited about this
01:26:21 <dauwhe> ... they don't perceive the need from their customer base, as they don't see ebooks as their issue
01:26:30 <dauwhe> ... it's been a low priority for my entire history
01:26:55 <dauwhe> ... the only  progress was when HP had a rep on the CSSWG and working on the spec, and paying a dev to fix printing bugs in Mozilla
01:27:03 <dauwhe> ... Apple is the most interested, because they have iBooks
01:27:22 <dauwhe> ... my advice is to follow the model of the Japanese publishing industry used for writing modes
01:27:34 <dauwhe> ... getting in front of browser dev teams, saying we are your customers
01:27:45 <dauwhe> ... and so the devs and their management understand
01:28:12 <dauwhe> ... and they also needed to put resources into underfunded activities like building a test suite and sponsoring spec work
01:28:22 <dauwhe> ... it was a big project, and Japanese industry helped make it happen
01:29:03 <dauwhe> Florian: I agree with both of you
01:29:18 <dauwhe> ... the difficulty with multicol and columns going to the wrong place
01:29:24 <dauwhe> ... it's a problem on the web too
01:29:46 <dauwhe> ... I have a half-written draft of a cleaner webkit fix
01:30:11 <dauwhe> ... if it's only happening because of interested individuals, it will move slowly
01:30:25 <dauwhe> ... you need resources to push things forward
01:31:24 <dauwhe> ... there are companies that work on browser engines that could be paid like Igalia
01:32:16 <dauwhe> laudrain: someday it might be possible to do very sophisticated layouts directly in HTML and CSS
01:32:52 <dauwhe> ... another pass would be as all these sophisticated books are done in InDesign, would it be possible to imagine a conversion of an InDesign page layout
01:33:09 <dauwhe> ... to convert it to HTML/CSS but maybe it will lack some implementations
01:33:34 <dauwhe> ... and then this conversion could give us a pretty good version of the page as it is in InDesign
01:33:49 <dauwhe> ... and then it will adapt automatically
01:34:07 <dauwhe> ... is this something we could figure out?
01:34:18 <dauwhe> nmccully: I would love for that to happen
01:34:46 <dauwhe> ... but designers who care about design intent in print often don't understand fluid design
01:35:21 <dauwhe> ... we need to help the design community understand that dynamically changing design needs tools like the grid inspector
01:35:39 <dauwhe> ... the coding of each css feature is still unreachable to many people
01:36:09 <dauwhe> ... manga and visual storytelling, maybe they're already in that mindset, placing a dynamic thing into a 2d model
01:36:18 <dauwhe> ... those are the people who will figure this out
01:36:52 <dauwhe> RA: the problem with visual builders of web stuff
01:37:15 <dauwhe> ... we have the same issue with dreamweaver or wysiwyg HTML editors
01:37:21 <dauwhe> ... and then they freak out when it changes size
01:37:35 <dauwhe> ... it's hard for the tools to help with adapting stuff
01:37:42 <dauwhe> ... maybe it's easier now we have grid
01:38:02 <dauwhe> ... they think the example layout they design will be seen by everyone
01:38:26 <dauwhe> fantasai: I don't think that converting from InDesign to what you talk about
01:38:33 <dauwhe> ... it's built on fixed-size boxes
01:38:37 <dauwhe> ... and regions
01:38:56 <dauwhe> ... and we don't have those things in CSS
01:39:04 <dauwhe> ... the reflow in CSS is very sophisticated
01:39:11 <dauwhe> ... that can't be expressed in InDesign
01:39:19 <dauwhe> ... you could probably do media queries and scaling
01:39:30 <dauwhe> ... but when you have overlap or flex fractions, and minmax
01:39:55 <dauwhe> ... and different levels of squishiness, indesign doesn't know about that
01:40:08 <dauwhe> ... but I don't think that InDesign is the tool for this

02:07:23 <fantasai> Topic: Wrap-up Discussions
02:08:02 <fantasai> SP: Wanted to as for feedback about our vocabulary for comics presentation.
02:08:10 <fantasai> s/as for/ask for/
02:08:32 <fantasai> makoto: On Behalf of APL, want to make a comment.
02:08:59 <fantasai> ... We like the idea of making an open standard for describing this kind of art, but not ready to discuss details of such things.
02:09:07 <fantasai> ... Starting with taxonomy is a good idea.
02:09:22 <fantasai> ... We're interested in maybe pursuing in a Community Group at W3C
02:10:06 <fantasai> Ivan: Community Group at W3C is simple thing, they create reports, not standards. They're an incubation space for developing together, provides just some basic infrastructure like wiki, mailing list. Takes about 1hr to create, and is free to participate.
02:10:18 <laudrain> laudrain has joined #tokyows
02:10:35 <fantasai> llemeur: We at EDRLab are committed to join a CG at W3C, seems like a good idea.
02:10:48 <fantasai> ... We got a lot of feedback, and would be interesting to work on a complete CSS implementation
02:11:03 <fantasai> ... Good place to make the taxonomy, use case list, etc. more visible and to make it more in the direction of the Web.
02:11:11 <fantasai> ... We completely agree and we will do it!
02:11:50 <fantasai> Laurent: Discussed with Rachel that authors should be involved in such a work
02:11:56 <fantasai> ... Working on a taxonomy is the best time to join.
02:12:29 <fantasai> ... So even if authors are afraid of technical environment of W3C, working on taxonomy can be more approachable
02:12:48 <fantasai> SP: we at IDPF co-organized with Hachette and Kodansha a workshop
02:12:54 <fantasai> ... We succeeded to have ? on stage
02:13:26 <fantasai> ... It is always difficult in technical points, but if the point is taxonomy and use cases, this is more understandable for authors and is a better starting point
02:13:49 <fantasai> Ivan: So let's agree that we will will work on this next week. Write a text on what you want to achieve, and we will distribute to workshop participants to start.
02:15:11 <fantasai> Florian: We could have a breakout session at TPAC, and can announce the session at TPAC. Hard to do anything else.
02:15:27 <fantasai> r12a: As an outsider, it seems like you are all going in different directions
02:15:50 <fantasai> ... Seems like movement needs to harmonize the different actors and parts of the technology
02:16:19 <fantasai> ... Lots of different things happening, but all happening to solve a problem that's real
02:16:25 <fantasai> ... Might have better leverage if more coordinated
02:16:59 <fantasai> ???: Two tracks in the workshop it seems. One is digitizing comics. Other is evolution of ebook layout, mostly text-heavy work on screen.
02:17:06 <fantasai> ???: I think we would have to create two trends.
02:17:24 <fantasai> ???: We can't mix in the CG things about responsive layout and the fixed-layout comics
02:17:38 <fantasai> Ivan: CG would be a first forum for this discussion.
02:17:57 <fantasai> ... It might turn out that there are two directions that represent distinct work, then there's room for another CG.
02:18:26 <fantasai> ... Additionally, we have to be very careful that the work you do — whether one or two CGs, doesn't matter — make sure that it is synchronized with the relevant WGs
02:18:40 <fantasai> ... Set up a regular exchange of information
02:19:09 <fantasai> ... Once you have figured out where to apply the pressure, don't let up.
02:19:20 <fantasai> dauwhe: My concern about splitting is that this really is One Web.
02:20:00 <fantasai> ... There were lots of good presentations about different points on the spectrum between responsive presentations and fixed layout, don't want to artificially divide the community
02:20:20 <fantasai> Florian: If our goal is to find one true format for books, then it's going to be a huge project.
02:20:28 <fantasai> ... But that is not my impression of what EDRLab is trying to do
02:20:43 <fantasai> ... More that they are trying to solve some specific subset of the problem.
02:20:54 <fantasai> ... If we try to solve everything, effort will fail.
02:21:18 <fantasai> ... But cost-effective production of commonly-found paradigms, then it's quite possible.
02:21:33 <fantasai> ... and we can put things out of scope and achieve something.
02:21:44 <fantasai> laudrain: I completely agree. We have to focus.
02:22:28 <fantasai> ... Also with respect to fixed layout for e.g. textbooks etc, we don't need a new Community Group, we need to join the CSS Working Group. The publishing industry needs to be there, to apply the pressure.
02:22:45 <fantasai> Ivan: How do we convince the publishing industry that this is what has to happen.
02:23:07 <fantasai> ... If we just say something, say that "we should do this" and stop there, then nothing happens.
02:23:20 <fantasai> ... We need to find the people who can get involved, and get them involved.
02:23:35 <fantasai> ... And not done yet, need to find way to communicate with publishing industry in useful, proactive way.
02:23:51 <fantasai> ... You who are in this industry, how can we convince people that this must be done?
02:24:01 <fantasai> Florian: Yes, we have to make it happen; yes we have to do work.
02:24:14 <fantasai> ... But also, want to point out that not everything happens in a conference room.
02:24:23 <fantasai> ... CSSWG operates in a hybrid manner.
02:24:43 <fantasai> ... Yes we have F2F meetings, and some work happens there. But other work happens in telecons. Other work happens in GitHub.
02:25:16 <fantasai> ... Some groups focused on one work mode, CSS WG works in multiple. If you don't like meetings don't have to attend meetings. If you work best in meetings, come attend the meetings.
02:25:26 <fantasai> Ivan: Inviting to join the *virtual* table.
02:25:49 <fantasai> nmccully: I was inspired to see the creativity in the Web space, in the media space. It's exciting to see what's possible.
02:26:12 <fantasai> ... I think proofs of concept, small groups of people trying to achieve something, and then getting the word out will draw people to it.
02:26:26 <fantasai> ... Way to convince people, friends, publishing industry to join and participate.
02:26:48 <fantasai> ... That kind of draw, plus stick of if you don't adapt you die, is a good motivation.
02:27:15 <fantasai> laudrain: I'm afraid such sophisticated books are a very small portion of the industry.
02:27:33 <fantasai> ... It's a very big use case for us to be able to have some transformation from the indesign page to something that is CSS implementation.
02:27:49 <fantasai> nmccully: You come from an industry that is one of the most conservative that I have ever seen. very hard to convince anyone to move anywhere.
02:28:03 <fantasai> ... But competition is a way to encourage innovation.
02:28:19 <fantasai> ... Define yourself as leaders, as thought leaders.
02:28:30 <fantasai> Laudrain: We are successful with paper books.
02:28:44 <fantasai> Florian: Aside from Hachette, another company that has embraced the Web is O'Reilly.
02:29:31 <fantasai> ... Yes, their layouts are relatively simple. Easier to be pioneers in their approach. Using HTMl + CSS in production.
02:30:16 <fantasai> Ivan: There are different publishers which have different roles and business models than books.
02:30:39 <fantasai> ... THe publishing industry is way more diverse than we laypeople realize
02:31:07 <fantasai> Florian: It has multiple business models, but some business models would only be possible in moving to the Web.
02:31:24 <fantasai> Laudrain: We will have this as the next item on the agenda of publishing business group
02:31:51 <fantasai> Ivan: For those of you who represent bigger publishers, a way to join work at W3C without joining as a full member, can join the business group.
02:32:13 <fantasai> ... I think there were some other ideas and problems that came up in these 1.5 days
02:32:24 <fantasai> ... e.g. Bobby's issue about fonts and relationship with font community
02:32:32 <fantasai> ... Worth discussing what and how to do there.
02:32:45 <fantasai> Florian: Nat's presentation showed fonts being more and more important
02:32:56 <fantasai> ... should relate better fonts community and w3c community
02:33:25 <fantasai> makoto: SC29 is committee responsible for maintaining OpenType specification
02:33:39 <fantasai> ... And second is JIS, I called today they are willing to have a relationship with W3C
02:33:53 <florian> scribenick: florian
02:33:53 <florian> fantasai: having some kind of community for fonts is important
02:34:06 <florian> ... it comes on many topics, such as what bobby discussed
02:34:31 <florian> ... it also comes up because we lack font metrics for many writing systems, and cannot do good layout without that
02:34:47 <florian> ... so we need a relation / liaison with font people
02:35:09 <florian> ... I was at the Typo conference, talking about this need
02:35:23 <florian> ... and font people also didn't know how to report problems back to us
02:36:15 <florian> ... I think this all together could be a community of people who work on fonts, and for people in the css and the web.
02:36:44 <florian> ... we need to talk to people who make the open type specification, but also to font authors, so that we can have discussion about problematic fonts
02:37:13 <florian> ivan: so what should we do next? It sounds like we need to formal liaison, but also more.
02:37:41 <florian> fantasai: Maybe similarly to JL-TF, we may need a community of experts, so that we can talk to them
02:38:05 <florian> ... I have never succeeded in finding where they are, what their home page is
02:38:13 <florian> ivan: Maybe talk to Vlad
02:38:21 <florian> fantasai: also Chris Lilley
02:38:33 <florian> nmccully: CC me
02:38:47 <florian> Florian: I'm happy to be in the loop too
02:39:04 <florian> MM: isn't there a web fonts working group?
02:39:25 <florian> ivan: Yes, Chris is that group's team contact, and Vlad is the co-chair
02:39:32 <florian> ... but the scope of that group is different
02:40:03 <florian> Bobbytung: I think it is a good time to get people together
02:40:57 <fantasai> ScribeNick: fantasai
02:41:23 <fantasai> Florian: Short repeat of what said yesterday, but as talking about what to do next, want to remind people of r12a's invitation to join the JLTF and other Internationalization Activities
02:41:55 <fantasai> fantasai: And if you don't know how to get involved, talk to Richard Ishida or Kida-san
02:43:57 <laudrain> laudrain has joined #tokyows
02:44:01 <fantasai> r12a: When I was learning about paged media was paged media for epub or paged media for PDF.
02:44:53 <fantasai> ... I ended up with the wrong at-rules. One for print, but then I had to write the same rules for epub as for PDF generation in a different part of the style sheet, and it seemed there should be a single paged media media query and maybe get rid of the print one
02:45:27 <fantasai> Florian: I have an entire presentation on that topic, but short version is that media types like print are not granular enough
02:46:11 <fantasai> ... We have moved from media types to media features, you can ask "is this interactive?" "can I click on small things?" "Can I change it after it's rendered? Does it have fast enough updates to animate?"
02:46:21 <fantasai> ... We have a fair range of things in the spec, but that's the general approach
02:46:39 <fantasai> ... If you notice features of the media environment that you need to query but can't, then let us know in the CSSWG.
02:46:50 <fantasai> https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#mf-overflow-block
02:47:20 <r12a> r12a has joined #tokyows
02:47:25 <fantasai> dauwhe: Wanted to go back to organizational questions from a moment ago.
02:47:42 <fantasai> ... Talked about having a group to discuss font issues and interface with CSSWG + Font vendors + OpenType
02:47:53 <fantasai> ... Talked about group to discuss manga and comics and digitization
02:48:03 <fantasai> ... we came up with many suggestions in the workshop, how do we document them?
02:48:15 <fantasai> ... Many *LREQ groups, but who will be end-user of information they generate?
02:48:16 <florian> If you would like to know more, here is a video of a [20 minute presentation I made about the question richard asked about Media Queries](https://www.dotconferences.com/2017/11/florian-rivoal-media-queries-4).
02:48:48 <fantasai> dauwhe: How do we organize and coordinate these groups, and make sure information flows form one to the other?
02:48:50 <Murata> ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29
02:49:05 <fantasai> Ivan: Very good question, I don't have a direct answer. It's a problem at the W3C level
02:49:37 <fantasai> ... All the groups directly on publications or in the CGs, have a one-stop place where there is a one-stop place with a good set of references.
02:49:55 <fantasai> ... Requires a lot of work for people to gather these
02:50:24 <florian> scribenick: florian
02:50:24 <florian> fantasai: I think there are several approaches to coordination
02:50:36 <nmccully> nmccully has joined #tokyows
02:50:38 <florian> ... don't have groups that too small, there won't be enough people to link the communities, and not enough overlap among the topics to create integration
02:51:17 <Taro> Taro has joined #tokyows
02:51:27 <florian> ... to have coordination between two groups, you need either someone who is in both groups, or 2 people in each group who frequently talk to eachother
02:52:13 <florian> ... just joining the group and being passive isn't quite sufficient to establish a link, you need to be meaningfully involved in both
02:52:30 <florian> ... example: Dave Cramer links CSS-WG and Publishing
02:52:53 <florian> ... example2: Rachel Andrew links the CSS-WG and the broader web developer community
02:53:13 <florian> ... example3: I was the liaison between CSS and EPUB
02:53:34 <florian> ... so formal liaison is the solution, but for them to work active involvement is required
02:54:50 <florian> ivan: there are many people who are active in Publishing CG / WG / BG, but we need to be systematic when following that pattern
02:55:27 <florian> laurent: For coordination at the top, we need a new publishing champion
02:55:49 <florian> ... for the rest, we need blogs, hash tags
02:56:37 <florian> Bobbytung: different topic: based on the presentations yesterday, should we work on the description language for manga?
02:56:50 <florian> murata: APL isn't interested
02:57:10 <florian> laurent: XML is not very popular at the moment
02:57:31 <florian> ... so I think it would have to be out of W3C
02:58:17 <florian> ivan: I don't think that's true. If there is a community, we can have a group. XML is gone on the front end, but there's nothing stopping it in the backend, interchange, etc
02:58:41 <florian> ... it is true that front-end web development has moved away from XML, but let's not overgeneralize
02:58:52 <florian> dauwhe: back on coordination
02:59:13 <florian> ... I would like to have a some a repository where we can post issues to triage things
02:59:20 <florian> fantasai: who is "we"?
02:59:59 <florian> ... there are plenty of repos to track issues on many topics. What is the new repo for?
03:00:54 <florian> dauwhe: sometimes it's not clear where some issues fit, so a place to do triage
03:01:20 <florian> fantasai: but what's the scope? this work shop? all workshops? anything publishing ? any topic?
03:02:29 <florian> ivan: the publishing business group is sort of meant to serve that role, maybe it could have a repo
03:02:33 <florian> dauwhe: maybe
03:02:47 <florian> ivan: Luc, please talk to the co-chair of the business group:-)
03:02:33 <florian> Topic: closing
03:07:45 <florian> ivan: [explains what happens next] report will be posted in 2 or 3 weeks, minutes will be cleaned up, community group will be created, and everybody who was registered will be notified by email
